      <h2>Corona Virus News:-</h2>
      <h3>
        Today 26,727 corona cases and 277 deaths have been registered in India.
        Today 1,010 covid cases, 13 people died from covid in last 24 hours in
        Andhra Pradesh. Over 86.51 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses have been
        provided to states and union territories so far through the Centre's
        free of cost channel and direct state procurement category, the Union
        health ministry said on Thursday. More than 63.69 lakh doses (63,69,890)
        are in the process of being supplied to states and union territories
        (UTs), it said. The ministry said that 5,00,46,000 doses are balance and
        unutilised and are still available with the states and UTs. Some of
        India's private hospitals have cancelled orders for Russia's Sputnik V
        vaccine as they struggle to sell COVID-19 shots amid surging supplies of
        free doses of other vaccines offered by the government. Some industry
        officials said low demand and the extremely cold storage temperatures
        required have spurred at least three big hospitals to cancel orders for
        Sputnik V, which is sold only on the private market in the world's
        biggest producer of vaccines. Govt says 69% of India’s adult population
        has got at least one dose of Covid vaccine, 25% got both doses. India
        may soon join the likes of the US and other European nations and
        administer booster shots for the vulnerable population. It should be
        noted that the WHO has time now and time again spoken against the trend
        of booster shots. There has been a decline of more than 5,000 active
        cases, the data shows. At present, India has 2,77,020 active cases. This
        is the lowest level of active cases in the last 195 days, Thursday’s
        health bulletin says.

        India is processing about 70% of daily waste.we have to take it to 100%:
        PM Modi at launch of Swachch Bharat 2.0:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday (October 1, 2021) launched Swachh
        Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) 2.0 and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and
        Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 at Dr Ambedkar International Centre in
        New Delhi. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 and Atal Mission for
        Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation 2.0 have been designed to realise
        the aspiration to make all our cities `Garbage Free` and `Water Secure`.
        "The aim of Swach Bharat Mission 2.0 is to make the cities garbage-free.
        With this 2nd phase, we also aim sewage and safety management, making
        cities water-secure and ensuring that dirty nullahs don't merge into
        rivers," said PM Modi at the event. "Toffee wrappers are no more thrown
        on floors but kept in pockets. Kids alert elders not to litter around.
        The youth are taking initiative. Some are earning wealth from waste,
        while some are creating awareness. There is segregation of dry and wet
        waste, there's awareness," PM Narendra Modi added. The prime minister
        revealed that the country is processing about 1 lakh tonnes of waste
        every day currently, adding that at the start of these missions this was
        as low as 20 percent. PM Modi also revealed that India is currently
        processing about 70% of daily waste, and emphasised upon the need to
        take this number to 100 percent. “The garbage mountains in cities will
        be processed and removed completely as part of Swachta second phase. One
        such garbage mountain has been in Delhi for long, it's also waiting to
        be removed…,” PM Modi said at the launch. These two flagship missions
        are a step forward in our aim of effectively addressing the challenges
        of rapidly urbanizing India and will also help contribute towards the
        achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, said the PM. The
        outlay of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 is around Rs 1.41 lakh crore.
        This mission aims to provide 100 percent coverage of water supply to all
        households in around 4,700 urban local bodies by providing about 2.68
        crore tap connections and 100% coverage of sewerage and septage in 500
        AMRUT cities by providing around 2.64 crore sewer/ septage connections,
        which will benefit more than 10.5 crore people in urban areas. The
        outlay of AMRUT 2.0 is around Rs 2.87 lakh crore.

        <q>India Women vs Australia Women Pink Ball Test:-</q> Smriti Mandhana
        headlined a rain-hit opening day with a career-best 80 not out which had
        elegance written all over it as the Indian women’s cricket team finished
        on 132 for 1 in the one-off Day/Night Test against Australia here.
        Mandhana, who peppered the off-side field repeatedly with some gorgeous
        shots to reach 80 off 144 balls with 15 boundaries and a six, added 93
        for the opening stand with Shafali Verma (31 off 64 balls), who played
        the second fiddle during their partnership. Most of the second session’s
        play was washed out but Mandhana added another 16 runs to surpass her
        previous best of 78. She pulled Tahlia McGrath for a six over deep
        square leg and also carted the same bowler over mid-wicket for a
        boundary. Giving her company is Punam Raut (16 batting, 57 balls) and
        they added 39 runs for the unbroken second wicket stand before rain
        stopped play in the 45th over and didn’t start again. A total of 300
        plus will certainly keep India firmly in the game as first day of test
        ends.

        IPL:- CSK vs SRH:- Chennai Super Kings became the first team to qualify
        for the playoffs and Sunrisers Hyderabad became the first to be
        eliminated following the MS Dhoni-led side's six-wicket victory at the
        Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Thursday (September 30).Barring the first
        game in Sharjah in this edition of the IPL, when both Royal Challengers
        Bangalore and the Super Kings managed in excess of 50 without losing a
        wicket in the powerplay, the scoring rates in the four other innings
        have all been less than eight, with at least a wicket going down in each
        of those innings. The trend continued in this game too, despite
        Wriddhiman Saha's brisk start, as the Sunrisers ended up with 41 for 1
        in the first six overs. Only 5 came in the first two overs and while
        Saha struck two sixes off Deepak Chahar - over deep midwicket and
        long-off - Roy struggled to get going at the other end. The England
        batter eventually fell to Josh Hazlewood's scrambled seam delivery for a
        seven-ball 2 as he got an under edge while trying to play across the
        line. Dwayne Bravo struck in his first over to pick up the important
        wicket of Williamson - the Sunrisers skipper missed a full delivery that
        curled away a bit and was trapped in front. Saha, meanwhile, had a lucky
        break when he guided a Shardul Thakur delivery straight to point as a
        signal came from the TV umpire's box that the bowler had over-stepped.
        But the boundaries dried up as the Super Kings bowlers applied the
        stranglehold. Priyam Garg, in his attempt to end the drought, top-edged
        a pull off Bravo while Saha fell trying a pull off Jadeja - with Dhoni
        holding on to both top-edges - as the Sunrisers slipped to 74/4 in the
        13th over. The Sunrisers went without a boundary for 48 deliveries
        before Abdul Samad flayed a Thakur delivery through cover while Abhishek
        tickled one fine for a couple of much-needed fours. Hazlewood hit back
        in style with the wickets of the set batsmen, finishing with his best
        figures in the IPL. Jason Holder didn't stay long to do any damage,
        handing a catch in the deep off Thakur, who conceded 11 runs in the
        penultimate over and Rashid scoring a 13-ball 17. They still ended up
        with their lowest ever total against the Super Kings, and the Chennai
        team - whose only loss in chases of totals below 135 came way back 2008
        - ensured they did not add to it. Having restricted the Sunrisers to
        134/7, the Super Kings started the chase well thanks to their openers,
        had some nervy moments leading to the close, before Ambati Rayudu and MS
        Dhoni sealed the chase with two balls to spare. After a slow start to
        the chase, with only 12 runs coming in the first three overs, Ruturaj
        Gaikwad and Faf du Plessis chose to target Bhuvneshwar Kumar, going over
        deep mid-wicket and long on respectively for two sixes in the fourth
        over. The former South Africa captain sustained the momentum with two
        fours off Jason Holder while Rashid Khan wasn't spared either as Gaikwad
        top-edged a four and went straight over the bowler's head for a six.
        Having already extended their partnership runs past 500 in this IPL,
        Gaikwad and du Plessis went past Michael Hussey and Suresh Raina's tally
        of 587 runs in 2013 during their 75-run association that came in only 10
        overs. The openers extended their fours tally to seven and sixes to four
        by the time the 10th over was completed - the same number that the
        Sunrisers managed for their entire innings. It was in the 11th over that
        Holder delivered the first wicket for the Sunrisers as he dismissed
        Gaikwad five short of a half-century. Moeen Ali struck a couple of
        boundaries in his knock of 17 before he got an under-edge off Rashid
        that struck his pad and hit the stumps. Raina missed a flick and was out
        leg-before to Holder, who also had du Plessis miscuing. It came down to
        16 off the last two overs as Ambati Rayudu struck a crucial four off
        Kaul after Jason Roy nearly took a blinder that would have sent Dhoni
        back. Bhuvneshwar, however, erred with his lengths as Rayudu put away a
        half volley for a six while Dhoni flat-batted a short ball through cow
        corner for a four. With three required off the final over, Rayudu played
        a dot ball and took a single. Dhoni too played a dot before bringing out
        his famed finishing six as he sent the fourth ball sailing to the deep
        midwicket stand. CSK beat SRH by 6 wickets.

        in their national statements at the 76th UNGA session's General Debate
        that ran through September 21-27. Suriname President Chandrikapersad
        Santokhi, in his address, expressed his sincere gratitude to the
        countries and organisations "who expressed solidarity and had provided
        valuable support to my country and people in the battle against this
        pandemic, at a very early stage." "Our thanks extend especially to the
        Kingdom of the Netherlands, India, China and also the USA," Santokhi
        said. Nauru President Lionel Rouwen Aingimea said his country's efforts
        to respond to COVID-19 and vaccinate its people "would not have been
        possible without the valuable support provided by our partners. We are
        truly grateful to our genuine friends Australia, India, Japan and
        Republic of China (Taiwan), for their ongoing assistance." Nigeria's
        President Muhammadu Buhari said Abuja remains grateful for the
        assistance received from its partners and friends all over the world.
        "Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We
        fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We
        also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European
        Union, and others for the vaccines provided," Buhari said. Prime
        Minister of Saint Lucia Philip Pierre said the "insidious" nature of the
        coronavirus has allowed it to sneak across even the most heavily
        patrolled borders, and Saint Lucia has experienced waves of highs and
        lows in managing this pandemic. "We extend our deepest gratitude to
        international institutions such as the COVAX Facility, and our many
        bilateral partners such as India and the United States of America, for
        their commitment to ensuring that we in Saint Lucia and by extension the
        Caribbean region, were not further disadvantaged by our inability to
        access vaccines," he said. India will resume the export of surplus
        COVID-19 vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the 'Vaccine
        Maitri' programme and meet its commitment to the COVAX global pool. The
        Indian government had stopped the export of COVID-19 vaccines after the
        second wave of the pandemic hit the country in April this year. India
        has exported over 66 million vaccine doses to nearly 100 countries
        through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX facility. At

        access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the
        Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health
        Organization. The Indian government had stopped the export of COVID-19
        vaccines after the second wave of the pandemic hit the country in April
        this year. India has exported over 66 million vaccine doses to nearly
        100 countries through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX
        facility. Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph
        Gonsalves said it is "timely to remind all of us that the noblest form
        of solidarity is to give not from the abundance or surplus that we may
        have but from the little that we possess; that is the lesson of the
        proverbial widow's mite." "On behalf of the Caribbean, I thank the
        government of the Republic of India for their early, and meaningful gift
        of Covishield Astrazeneca vaccines. Sadly, at least one country in the
        North Atlantic has refused to recognise Covishield for entry of persons
        into that country," Gonsalves said. He was referring to the Serum
        Institute of India manufactured vaccine that was not included in the
        list of eligible COVID-19 vaccines recognised under the UK's new
        international travel norms. Ghana had also termed as "unfortunate" the
        development in "some countries in Europe" of not recognising the
        Covishield vaccine manufactured in India for travellers. Australian
        Prime Minister Scott Morrison said "we are investing more than USD 620
        million to procure millions of vaccine doses, and providing technical
        advice, training of health workers, and cold chain support to friends
        and neighbours. "Now this includes a USD 100 million contribution to the
        Quad Vaccine Partnership with our good friends the United States, India
        and Japan. This will support a boost in production by at least one
        billion doses by the end of 2022, and provide access to vaccines and
        delivery support to countries across the Indo-Pacific. This is the right
        thing to do," he said.
