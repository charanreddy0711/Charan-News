        India Foils Chinese Incursion in Arunachal Pradesh, Briefly Detains PLA
        Troops:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        few troops from China were temporary detained by Indian soldiers in
        Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang after around 200 of them crossed over into
        the Indian side from Tibet and attempted to damage unoccupied bunkers,
        highly placed government sources said. The incident took place last week
        between the border pass of Bum La and Yangtse, close to the Line of
        Actual Control (LAC). According to sources, the Chinese patrol party’s
        transgression into the Indian side of the LAC was strongly contested by
        Indian troops and a few Chinese soldiers were temporarily detained. “The
        matter was subsequently resolved at the local military commanders’
        level. The Chinese soldiers were released and situation was defused,” a
        source in the government said. There was no official comment from the
        Army on the incident. However, defence and security sources said that
        there has been no damage to Indian defences. A show of Chinese
        aggression in the region is not new. In 2016, more than 200 Chinese
        troops had reportedly transgressed into the Indian side of the LAC at
        Yangtse, but had gone back in a few hours. In 2011, Chinese troops had
        tried to scale a 250-metre-long wall on the Indian side of the LAC and
        damaged it, leading to New Delhi lodging a protest with Beijing. The
        latest transgression comes just over a month after a similar intrusion
        wherein Chinese troops had reportedly carried out aggressive patrolling
        in Uttarakhand’s Barahoti sector near the LAC. As per a report in the
        Economic Times, the Chinese had spent a few hours in the sector before
        turning back. Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh has traditionally remained a
        friction point between India and China. In the 1962 war, China had
        captured Tawang within the first few days. It had laid claim on Tawang
        as part of a larger Tibet, while claiming Arunachal Pradesh as southern
        Tibet. The historical significance of Tawang stems from the fact that it
        is the birthplace of the sixth Dalai Lama and is an important seat in
        Tibetan Buddhism after Lhasa. Strategically, Tawang provides
        geographical access up to the Brahmaputra plains and provides the
        shortest axis to Tezpur in Assam. At present, Indian troops are
        preparing to brace yet another harsh winter across the LAC. While China
        has been carrying out major infrastructure upgradation on its side of
        the LAC, India too has developed rapid and mass-scale infrastructure in
        the region for thousands of the additional 50,000-60,000 troops inducted
        at the LAC — mostly in eastern Ladakh — since last year.

        A 55-year-old man was shot dead while offering namaz at a mosque in a
        village in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar Thursday, police said. The
        incident took place in Kolua village in the Chilia area. An unidentified
        person fired at Kamruzzama from behind when he was reciting Quran after
        “azan” about 5 am, Additional Superintendent of Police (SP), Suresh
        Chand Rawat said. A detailed probe in the matter is on. No arrests have
        been made in this case so far.

      <h2>Building in east Bengaluru leans, collapses:-</h2>
      <p>
        A five-storey building collapsed in Doctors Layout, Kasturi Nagar, east
        Bengaluru, on Thursday. Around 12:30pm, residents of Sunshine Apartment
        felt a sudden impact as one of the pillars in the structure began
        leaning to the right. Residents evacuated the building within half an
        hour, and the ground floor gave away around 1pm; the structure
        threatened to crumble on the adjacent building. The eight-year-old
        building stood on a 60ftX40ft plot and had eight residential units, only
        three of which were occupied. According to BBMP’s complaint to local
        police, the apartment was a joint venture of AN Builders, Ayesha Baig,
        Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Iyasuddin. The collapsed structures comprised
        of a basement, ground floor and three upper floors.

      <h2>The relative of the teacher shot dead by terrorists on it:-</h2>
      <p>
        Speaking to news agency ANI, a relative of the slain school teacher,
        Deepak Chand, described Kashmir as "hell" not "heaven". "We are still
        receiving threat calls. Kashmir is not heaven, it's hell. We're are
        being targeted for the last 30 years," he said. The gunmen ploughed into
        the Government Boys Higher Secondary School in the Eidgah area of
        Srinagar and shot both the principal and a teacher dead. Students were
        not present at the time of the shooting. The principal of the school has
        been identified as Supinder Kaur while the teacher, a Kashmiri Pandit,
        has been identified as Deepak Chand. Two days earlier, terrorists
        affiliated with The Resistance Front (TRF) killed three civilians in
        three separate shootings on separate streets within 90 minutes. While
        Kashmiri Hindu pharmacist Makhan Lal Bindroo and a non-Kashmiri street
        vendor, Virendra Paswan (who hailed from Bihar) were killed in Srinagar,
        another civilian, Mohammad Shafi Lone, was shot dead at Naidkhai in
        Bandipora district of north Kashmir.

        India to pay 50,000 ruppees compensation for every covid death. India
        has officially recorded more than 4,47,000 Covid-19 deaths so far.
        However, experts believe that up to 10 times more people could have died
        in the pandemic. They have arrived at different estimates after
        examining excess deaths - a measure of how many more people are dying
        than would be expected compared to the previous few years. On Monday
        Justice MR Shah said the "next of kith and kin of the deceased person"
        shall be paid this compensation. This would be "over and above the
        amounts paid by the centre and state under various benevolent schemes",
        he said. The court added that the compensation should be paid within 30
        days after a family submits an application. In June, petitioners sought
        the court's intervention in paying compensation to the families of
        Covid-19 victims. They said since Covid-19 was "specially" notified as a
        disaster under India's National Disaster Management Act, compensation
        should be paid to the victims. The 2005 law was enacted for efficient
        management of disasters, including preparation of mitigation strategies,
        capacity-building and compensation for lost lives, injuries and damaged
        properties. The law says monetary assistance of 400,000 rupees should be
        paid to family of people who have lost their lives in a disaster. "We
        know the government has spent a lot of money in managing the pandemic.
        But we still think the government should have paid 400,000 rupees
        compensation to every affected family according to the law. Or they
        could have given a higher amount to the poor families and less to the
        well-to do. They could have bettered it," Gaurav Kumar Bansal, one of
        the petitioners, told the BBC. Some states like Karnataka have already
        announced a higher compensation of 1,00,000 rupees to the families of
        underprivileged people who died of Covid-19.

        <q>IPL:-</q> <q>KKR vs RR:-</q> Kolkata Knight Riders have set one foot
        in the playoffs after a commanding win over Rajasthan Royals, with the
        curtains also drawn on Punjab Kings's campaign in the process. Having
        scored the highest total in Sharjah batting first this season, some
        astute bowling had them bowl out RR for 85 on Thursday (October 7). KKR
        picked up a comprehensive 86-run win, putting an end to a rather dismal
        outing for RR in the UAE leg. KKR's clinical win now leaves MI with the
        improbable task of beating Sunrisers Hyderabad by around 171 runs after
        scoring 200 in order to get past KKR's NRR. However, if MI chase, they
        cannot go beyond KKR. Owing to the fact that RR's bowlers learnt well
        from their last game in Sharjah. They took a cue from MI's bowlers from
        their first game at Sharjah and bowled hard lengths and pulled it back
        from time to time too. They bowled good lengths, varied the pace, used
        the cross-seamers and cutters effectively on a wicket with low bounce.
        The pacers bowled stump to stump and did well to keep KKR's batsmen in
        check, but couldn't get the breakthrough for the first 10 overs with 69
        on the board. A settled Shubman Gill switched gears soon after spin was
        introduced with five seamers used for the first ten overs. He went after
        Rahul Tewatia and Phillips - playing straight and cleared the fence with
        elegant ease. Tewatia struck back with Venkatesh Iyer's wicket while
        Phillips got Nitish Rana. It made little difference to Gill, who along
        with an aggressive Tripathi, accelerated. Gill played proper cricket
        shots without taking too much of a risk, playing straight and avoiding
        playing across the line. Gill got to his fifty off 40 balls but fell
        soon after. Eoin Morgan picked 16 in the final over to take them over
        the 170-run mark.Shakib Al Hasan struck three balls into the opening
        over after Yashasvi Jaiswal went for the reverse. After looking already
        unsettled, he went after Shakib a tad too soon and paid the price. Sanju
        Samson in the next over clipped Shivam Mavi to midwicket and Lockie
        Ferguson undid RR's batsmen with his sheer raw pace, striking twice in
        his first over to send back Liam Livingstone and Anuj Rawat. Evin Lewis
        missed out on the clash with a niggle, bringing back Livingstone, but
        the English all-rounder's IPL stint ended with disappointment with a
        brilliant catch taken in the deep by Rahul Tripathi and RR were reduced
        to 13 for 4 after 4 overs. RR finished with their second-lowest
        powerplay score in the history of the IPL with 17/4 on the board after 6
        overs. Mavi was too quick for both Glenn Phillips and Shivam Dube,
        knocking both of them over with short of length deliveries that didn't
        bounce enough. Chris Morris's dismal second-half of this year's IPL came
        to an end with a silver duck. However, Rahul Tewatia kept KKR waiting
        for the win with a stubborn 44 off 35 on a ground he loves batting.
        However, he couldn't pull off a miracle like he did last year, as RR
        were bowled out for the lowest total this season, with Mavi finishing
        with 4-21 - his best figures in T20 cricket.
