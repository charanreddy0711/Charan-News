    <h2>Corona Virus News:-</h2>
    <h3>
      Today 34,403 corona cases and 320 deaths have been registered in India.
      Today 1,367 covid cases, 14 people died from covid in last 24 hours in
      Andhra Pradesh. A study of 614 fully vaccinated health workers in India
      found a "significant" drop in their COVID-fighting antibodies within four
      months of the first shot. The findings could help the government decide
      whether to provide booster doses as some Western countries have done.
      Waning antibodies do not necessarily mean that immunised people lose their
      ability to counter the disease, as the body's memory cells may still kick
      in to offer substantial protection, said the director of a state-run
      institute that did the study. "After six months, we should be able to tell
      you more clearly whether and when a booster would be needed," Sanghamitra
      Pati of the Regional Medical Research Centre, based in Bhubaneswar, told
      Reuters on Tuesday. "And we would urge similar studies in different areas
      for pan-India data." British researchers said last month that protection
      offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the AstraZeneca vaccines
      begins to fade within six months. The US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) authorised Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents aged 12
      to 15 years old and the European Union also cleared the vaccine for
      children in May. Other countries including France, Germany, and Canada,
      among others have also begun inoculating adolescents. Children aged 12 to
      15 in the UK are also eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine,. The Indian
      government plans to begin vaccinating children in the 12-17 age group who
      have comorbidities by October.

      U.S., U.K. and Australia announce new security partnership for
      Indo-Pacific:-
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A week before a meeting of Quad leaders in Washington DC, the Biden
      administration, on September 15, announced a new trilateral security
      partnership for the Indo-Pacific, between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.
      (AUKUS). As part of this, Australia will acquire nuclear-powered
      submarines with help from the U.K. and the U.S. “The future of the
      Indo-Pacific will impact all our futures,” British Prime Minister Mr.
      Morrison said, adding that AUKUS will enhance Australia’s contribution to
      its other partnerships, including the Quad. “The future of the
      Indo-Pacific will impact all our futures,” Mr. Morrison said, adding that
      AUKUS will enhance Australia’s contribution to its other partnerships,
      including the Quad. Tensions have been high between Australia and an
      increasingly assertive China, its largest trade partner. Australia banned
      Chinese telecom giant Huawei in 2018 and Mr. Morrison called for an
      investigation into the origins of COVID-19 last year. China retaliated by
      imposing tariffs on or capping Australian exports.

    <h2>Space News:-</h2>
    <h3>
      ‘India’s first solar mission likely to launch next year’: ISRO. The solar
      mission, Aditya L1, will provide more insights into the origin of the
      universe and many other unknowns. India’s first solar mission, which was
      pushed from early 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is likely to be
      launched in the third quarter of 2022, when the country’s second space
      observatory Xposat, aimed at helping astronomers study cosmic sources such
      as pulsars and supernova, will also be launched, senior officials from the
      Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said. The spacecraft in the
      Aditya L1 mission will be sent 1.5 million km away from the Earth to L1
      Lagrangian, a point between the Earth and the Sun where the gravitational
      pull of both the bodies on the satellite is equal to the centripetal force
      needed to keep the satellite in orbit. It is like a parking area in space
      and is great for observing several phenomena without hindrances from
      eclipses. Xposat will be the other purely scientific mission that the
      space agency will undertake next year. It will be launched aboard a small
      satellite launch vehicle, which is currently in the development phase. The
      new launch vehicle is likely to have its first development flight by
      December this year. ISRO qualifies a launch vehicle to be mission-ready
      after two successful development flights. “Xposat will allow us to study
      the polarisation of celestial events. It will be launched by an SSLV which
      is under development. The first development flight will be by the end of
      this year. Academicians are looking forward to the data generated from
      this mission,” said Nair. The SSLV, which is being developed for the
      commercial launch of small satellites, costs only ₹30 crore as compared to
      ₹120 crore for a polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV). The SSLV can be
      assembled by a team of six scientists within seven days in comparison to a
      team of 600 that takes a couple of months to assemble a PSLV. The Covid-19
      pandemic severely affected the number of launches ISRO could undertake in
      2020 and 2021. There has been a total of just four launches in the two
      years, of which, one was a purely commercial launch with the main payload
      being an earth observation satellite from Brazil called Amazonia-1. Before
      the pandemic, the space agency had planned for 20 launches in the
      financial year 2020-21, including the first unmanned flight under the
      Gaganyaan mission. The Gaganyaan mission is also likely to be undertaken
      by the end of 2022 or in early 2023.

    <h2>GST Council meeting today: Petrol to sell at Rs 75 per litre:-</h2>
    <h3>
      If the proposal gets the nod from the GST Council, then petrol is expected
      to sell at just Rs 75 per litre while diesel will retail at about Rs 68
      per litre. The council is also expected to review the GST rate on more
      than four dozen items, including online food delivery services. One of the
      major proposals that the GST Committee is likely to discuss is whether to
      bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime or not. Another proposal in
      front of the GST council suggests bringing food delivery services under
      GST. The suggestion if accepted is likely to make online food deliveries
      from Zomato and Swiggy a bit expensive. However, on the other hand, the
      ex-chequer could gain about Rs 2000 crore from taxing food delivery
      services. The GST council will also review GST rates on 32 goods and 29
      services. Some of the items include personal use medicines such as
      Zolgensma and Viltepso, solar PV modules, copper concentrate, carbonated
      beverage with fruit juice, coconut oil, scented sweet supari, oncology
      medicine, and diesel-electric locomotives.

      played 90 T20Is for India, and captained them in 45 of those matches,
      leading the side to victory in 27 of them.Kohli cited the "immense
      workload" he has been managing for most of the last decade, as an
      all-format player and as captain, as the reason for his decision. The BCCI
      are as yet to announce Kohli's successor as captain in the format. The
      move could Kohli dedicate time to his batting – following an extended
      purple patch spanning the majority of the last decade, Kohli has struggled
      since the pandemic-enforced break early in 2020. His last international
      century came in November 2019, in a pink-ball Test in Kolkata against
      Bangladesh. BCCI President, Mr Sourav Ganguly said: "Virat has been a true
      asset for Indian Cricket and has led with aplomb. He is one of the most
      successful captains in all the formats. The decision has been made keeping
      in mind the future roadmap. We thank Virat for his tremendous performance
      as the T20I Captain. We wish him all the best for the upcoming World Cup
      and beyond and hope that he continues to score plenty of runs for India.”
      Honorary Secretary, Mr Jay Shah said: "We have a clear roadmap for Team
      India. Considering the workloads and ensuring that we have smooth
      transition, Mr Virat Kohli has decided to step down as T20I Captain after
      the upcoming World Cup. I have been in discussions with Virat and the
      leadership team for the last six months and the decision has been thought
      through. Virat will continue to contribute as a player and as a senior
      member of the side in shaping the future course of Indian cricket.

      Team India Coach: Ravi Shastri refuses extension, to step down after World
      Cup, BCCI to invite application for new coach:-
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Team India’s head coach is all set to step down after T20 World Cup. While
      there has been no official communication from BCCI or Shastri himself, it
      has been learnt that the Sourav Ganguly-led Indian board wanted to give
      him a month of extension for India’s Tour of South Africa in December but
      the coach has decided not to take the extension. However, it is still
      unclear whether Rahul Dravid, who is also out of contract for NCA chief’s,
      has been approached for a temporary role. There have been speculations
      that Rahul Dravid could take over the role but as the former India captain
      has reapplied for the NCA chief job, it is unlikely that he is interested
      in the top job. Instead, BCCI is set to invite applications for Team India
      coaching job after the T20 World Cup. BCCI will also not renew the
      contracts of assistant coaches despite their good performances. Rahul
      Dravid is “not interested” in the job at this moment but could accompany
      the team in South Africa as BCCI finalise a new coach. There is immense
      respect for the former India captain and if he decides to get on board,
      India will not need an additional batting coach. BCCI is expected to hire
      a new coaching staff ahead of the South Africa series. As Ravi Shastri has
      declined an extension.
