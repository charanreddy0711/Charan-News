      <h2>J&K Principal, Teacher Killed By Terrorists:-</h2>
      <p>
        The principal and a teacher of a government school were killed by
        terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Srinagar today, less than 48 hours
        after three civilians were gunned down by terrorists in separate
        incidents. Seven civilians have been killed in terror attacks in Kashmir
        in the last five days. The police chief of Jammu and Kashmir said the
        terror outfit "The Resistance Front" (TRF) is behind today's attack.
        While the teacher, Deepak Chand, is a Kashmir Pandit, woman principal,
        Supunder Kour, is a Sikh. They worked at the higher secondary school in
        Sangam, on the outskirts of Srinagar. "At about 11:15 am, terrorists
        shot dead two school teachers at Sangam Eidgah in Srinagar district," a
        police official said. He said the area has been cordoned off and a hunt
        has been launched to nail the attackers. National Conference leader and
        former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the
        latest killings. "Shocking news coming in again from Srinagar. Another
        set of targeted killings, this time of two teachers in a Govt school in
        Idgah area of the city. Words of condemnation are not enough for this
        inhuman act of terror but I pray for the souls of the deceased to rest
        in peace," he tweeted. On Tuesday, 70-year-old Makhan Lal Bindroo, a
        prominent businessman and the owner of a pharmacy in Srinagar's Iqbal
        Park, was shot at from point-blank range inside his pharmacy around 7
        pm, the police said. He was immediately rushed to a hospital where
        doctors declared him dead on arrival. A Kashmiri Pandit, Mr Bindroo
        remained in Kashmir and ran his pharmacy even at the peak of terrorism
        in the 1990s. The two others killed on Tuesday were a street food vendor
        in downtown Srinagar and another civilian in Bandipora. The man has been
        identified as Mohammad Shafi, the president of a taxi stand in the area.
        Comments The street food vendor was identified as Virender Paswan, a
        resident of Bhagalpur in Bihar.

      <h2>9 dead, 27 injured in bus-truck collision at Barabanki in UP:-</h2>
      <p>
        Nine people were killed and 27 injured in a head-on collision between a
        double decker bus and a truck under Dewa police station limits of Uttar
        Pradesh’s Barabanki district on Thursday morning, said police officers.
        The bus was ferrying passengers to Bahraich from Delhi via Lucknow, they
        added. Barabanki district magistrate Adarsh Singh and superintendent of
        police Yamuna Prasad said rescue operations were on and most of the
        injured were being treated at the Barabanki district hospital. Those
        with critical injuries, they said, had been sent to KGMU trauma centre
        in Lucknow. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed
        Barabanki district officials to provide best possible treatment to the
        injured and announced an ex gratia of ₹2 lakh each to the kin of the
        deceased and ₹50,000 to the injured. The local police officers said
        preliminary investigation suggested that the truck lost control and
        rammed into the bus coming from the opposite direction.

      <h2>WHO recommends broad use of world's first malaria vaccine:-</h2>
      <p>
        The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that it has
        recommended widespread use of the world's first malaria vaccine called
        RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) for children in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the
        WHO, the vaccine is the result of 30 years of research and development
        by British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in partnership
        with the international non-profit organization Program for Appropriate
        Technology in Health (PATH) and with a network of research centers in
        Africa. The WHO said its recommendation is based on results from more
        than 2.3 million doses of the vaccine that have been administered to
        more than 800,000 children in pilot countries Ghana, Kenya and Malawi
        since 2019, Xinhua news agency reported. According to the WHO, more than
        two-thirds of children in the three countries who were not sleeping
        under a bednet were benefiting from the vaccine, bringing about a 30
        percent drop in severe malaria, even when introduced in areas where
        insecticide-treated nets were widely used and there was good access to
        diagnosis and treatment. According to the WHO, "the vaccine should be
        provided in a schedule of four doses in children from five months of age
        for the reduction of malaria disease and burden." The WHO's records show
        that malaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in
        sub-Saharan Africa. More than 260,000 African children under the age of
        five die from the disease annually.

        Firefighters Still Struggle To Douse Kolkata Building Fire After 30
        Hours:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        A massive blaze that engulfed a four-storey building in Kolkata's
        congested Colootola area around 30 hours ago is yet to be completely
        doused, with firefighters still toiling hard to put out pockets of
        flames, a senior official said today. No casualties have been reported,
        but a few firemen are known to have sustained injuries during the course
        of the operation, he said. A portion of the rear side of the building,
        which housed several small business establishments and storerooms,
        collapsed early on Tuesday morning, the fire department official said.
        At least 10 fire tenders are struggling to put out the small pockets of
        fire. "Last night, our officers, along with the help of locals and
        disaster management personnel, managed to bring the blaze largely under
        control. There are still some pockets of fire, and our personnel are
        making all efforts to douse them. It may take some more time," he
        stated. Thirty fire tenders were pressed into service on Monday to
        contain the fire. A couple of blasts had also occurred in the building,
        likely because of the cooking gas cylinders stored inside.

        departments—who were working at stations, tracks and workshops, among
        other places—to Covid-19 since March 2020. Indian Railways has given
        jobs to more than 2,800 people, who are next of kin of employees who

        87 per cent of these people got railway jobs within four months. In most
        cases, it is the son or the wife who have taken up the job. In several
        other cases, the wives have requested that their employment be kept on
        hold till they complete their higher education in order to be eligible
        for higher profiles.

        <q>IPL:-</q> <q>RCB vs SRH:-</q> SRH defeated RCB by 4 runs George
        Garton delivered RCB their first PowerPlay wicket in this UAE leg with
        the scalp of Abhishek Sharma, but SRH still raced away to 50/1 six overs
        after being put in to the bat. Captain Kane Williamson shrugged off his
        indifferent form and returned to his silken best, driving past the ring
        of fielders on the off-side and pulling authoritatively. Garton, despite
        that early wicket, was taken for 29 in his two overs even as RCB's
        bowlers were otherwise disciplined with the way they operated. Slightly.
        Williamson and Jason Roy added 70 for the second wicket off just 58
        balls and while the latter enjoyed a couple of fortuitous moments when
        his miscued lofts fell between players, the experienced overseas batsmen
        in the SRH camp had set a platform to build a competitive score from.
        Their plans, though, were foiled by the familiar figure of Harshal
        Patel. A devilish slower ball found it's way through Williamson's
        attempts to meet it, and Kohli had his medium-pacers and the slow Abu
        Dhabi wicket to push SRH into a tailspin. Christian was the perfect foil
        in the conditions. He dismissed Priyam Garg and Roy (44 off 38) in one
        over. From 105 for 2 at the end of the 14 overs, SRH managed only 36 in
        the final six overs and lost five wickets along the way, three of them
        going to Harshal, who took his season tally to 29. Through that torrid
        phase, Holder got himself a couple of inside-edged fours to fine-leg,
        which given the state of the pitch and the end result, proved crucial.
        RCB needed a 12-run sixth over to even get to 37 after six. But by then
        they'd lost Virat Kohli and Daniel Christian with Rashid Khan still to
        come into the attack. Glenn Maxwell led a thrilling counter but Devdutt
        Padikkal's go-slow (41 off 52 balls) left RCB with a tad too much to get
        in the final overs. RCB were 38 for 3 at the end of seven overs. That
        would have been cue for Williamson to shut the door on the opposition
        with four overs of Rashid Khan in the bank. RCB's spin-crusher, Maxwell,
        though had other ideas. Off his second ball, he picked the legspinner
        and hit him over cow corner for six. In the spinners' next over, he slog
        swept one over long-on and swept powerfully for four more. Maxwell
        interspersed this with excellent running between the wickets and even
        though he had to contend with a slow-scoring partner in Padikkal, and a
        frugal Umran Malik, he kept up with the asking rate. Rashid conceded 24
        from his first two and was taken out of the attack. RCB needed 50 from
        the final six overs when Rashid came back into the attack. Off the first
        ball, Padikkal pushed one to cover and called his partner for a
        non-existent single. Williamson swooped in on the ball, picked it up and
        in one continuous motion hit the stumps at the keeper's end to dismiss
        Maxwell for a 25-ball 40.
