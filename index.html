    <h2>Corona Virus News:-</h2>
    <h3>
      Today 27,254 corona cases and 219+ deaths have been registered in
      India.Today 1,190 covid cases, 11 people died from covid in last 24 hours
      in Andhra Pradesh. More than 1 Crore people are completely vaccinated in
      Andhra Pradesh .All adult people in Sikkim, Dadra and Nagar Haveli,
      Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Ladakh and Lakshadweep have received at least one
      dose of Covid vaccine. 63% people want children vaccinated against
      Covid-19, finds survey. While 44.3% repondents said they would want an
      oral vaccine for children, 55.6% of them preferred the dose through
      injection. Last month, the chief of Centre's working group on Covid-19, Dr
      NK Arora, said Zydus Cadila's Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, approved for
      children in the age group of 12-17 years, would be rolled out in October.
      The vaccine received emergency-use approval on August 20. ZyCoV-D is an
      intradermal vaccine is to be applied using a ‘needle-free injector’, which
      the manufacturer says will help in reducing side effects. As delta surged
      in early summer, those who were unvaccinated were 4.5 times more likely
      than the fully vaccinated to get infected, over 10 times more likely to be
      hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die, according to the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention.

    <h2>China News:-</h2>
    <h3>
      A city in southern China that is trying to contain a coronavirus outbreak
      told the public Sunday not to leave town, suspended bus and train service
      and closed cinemas and other facilities.Anyone who needs to leave Putian,
      a city of 2.9 million people in Fujian province south of Shanghai, for an
      essential trip must have proof of a negative coronavirus test within the
      past 48 hours, the city government announced. China declared the
      coronavirus under control in early 2020 but has suffered outbreaks of the
      more contagious delta variant. Authorities say most cases are traced to
      travelers arriving from Russia, Myanmar and other countries. In Putian, 19
      new infections that were believed to have been acquired locally were
      reported in the 24 hours through midnight Saturday, according to the
      National Health Commission. One was reported in Quanzhou, also in Fujian.
      The first cases in Putian were students from Xianyou county, but experts
      suspect the outbreak might have originated with the father of one student
      who returned from Singapore on Aug 4. The traveler, identified by the
      surname Lin, underwent a 14-day quarantine and nine nucleic acid and
      serologic tests, all of which were negative, the Global Times said, citing
      local authorities. It said he tested positive on Friday. Residents of
      villages in Xianyou where infections were found were barred from leaving.
      Elsewhere in Putian, cinemas, card rooms, gyms, tourist sites and other
      facilities were ordered closed, the city government announced. Restaurants
      and supermarkets were told to “strictly control” customer numbers and to
      check for fevers. Schools were ordered to require students to wear masks
      in class. Experts were sent to Putian to oversee disease-control work, the
      Health Commission announced Saturday. China has reported 4,636 coronavirus
      deaths out of 95,199 confirmed cases.

    <h2>Afghanistan News:-</h2>
    <h3>
      On 8-09-21 China announced USD 31 million as aid to Afghanistan. Foreign
      Minister Wang Yi said China will provide Afghanistan with 200 million yuan
      (USD 31 million) worth of grains, winter supplies, vaccines and medicines
      as per its requirements. Border forces and armed police units deployed in
      the counter-terrorism grid have been directed by the central security
      establishment to prepare and administer a new training module on the
      Taliban. A full-fledged training, intelligence and combat module on
      Taliban, its leadership and their modus operandi is being prepared apart
      from specific case studies that have taken place in that country and the
      region, a senior officer said. The security forces are also enhancing
      their training quota of personnel for understanding IEDs (improvised
      explosive devices) and vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIEDs). IEDs remain a constant
      threat to the security personnel and their operations everywhere be it
      anti-Naxal operations or counter-terrorist duties. "However, for those
      deployed in the Kashmir valley knowing IEDs and VBIEDs, their detection
      and crippling is very important post the Afghanistan development," officer
      cited above said and referred to the fatal and non-fatal casualties
      suffered by the NATO forces from IEDs in Afghanistan.

    <h2>Indian Military News:-</h2>
    <h3>
      The drone attack on the Jammu Air Force Station on June 27 was a rude
      wake-up call for India to relook at existing options and enhance its
      anti-drone capabilities for unmanned warfare. In a series of orders, the
      armed forces have given contracts to Indian companies for a Made in India
      counter-drone system called Counter Unarmed Aircraft System (CUAS). Apart
      from the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force (IAF), other security agencies
      are also looking at immediately procuring the indigenous anti-drone
      capabilities without further delay. The systems being developed and given
      to the forces have both 'soft kill' and 'hard kill' capabilities. Soft
      kill refers to jamming the incoming drone rendering it ineffective, while
      a hard kill completely destroys the drone with a direct hit. Drone attacks
      are a cheap and easy option for which India needs to be better prepared.
      Experts feel that since the use of drones is rapidly growing, technology
      methods to combat them are also evolving. The latest among the contracts
      is the IAF placing an order worth Rs 155 crore for anti-drone platforms or
      Counter Unarmed Aircraft System. The contract was bagged by
      Hyderabad-based Zen Technologies that will supply the system within a
      year. “This is Zen Technologies' first significant order in the anti-drone
      space, and the company remains confident of securing additional orders in
      the future,” a statement from the company said.

      ></iframe>
      The IAF’s contract comes soon after the Indian Navy inked a contract with
      Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) for India’s indigenous Naval Anti Drone
      System (NADS).“The Naval Anti Drone System can instantly detect and jam
      micro drones and uses a laser-based kill mechanism to terminate targets.
      It will be an effective, all-encompassing counter to the increased drone
      threat to strategic naval installations,” a statement from the Ministry of
      Defence said. The anti-drone system was first deployed to provide security
      cover for the Republic Day parade this year and later during the Prime
      Minister's Independence Day address to the nation. The system, which
      offers 360-degree coverage, was also deployed in Ahmedabad for the
      Modi-Trump roadshow. The system comes in two versions — mobile and static
      — and both platforms will be available with the Indian Navy to secure its
      onshore installations. “This will be deployed for all critical assets,
      including navy’s airfields that have air assets,” an official said. With
      the help of radar, electro-optical/infrared sensors and radio frequency
      detectors, the drones can be detected and jammed. The DRDO’s RF/Global
      Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) detects the frequency which is being
      used by the controller and the signals are then jammed. “The anti-drone
      technology system of DRDO provides for both 'soft kill' and 'hard kill'
      options to the Indian Armed Forces to tackle fast-emerging aerial threats.
      Both the static and mobile versions of NADS will be supplied to the Indian
      Navy within a short time from the signing of the contract,” the Ministry
      of Defence said. The Indian Air Force (IAF) wants 10 anti-drone systems
      armed with laser-directed energy weapons to bring down rogue drones. The
      Request for Information (RFI) was issued a day after the attack on the
      Jammu Air Force Station, where Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were used
      to drop bombs. "It should provide a multi-sensor, multi-kill solution to
      enforce effective no-fly zones for unmanned aircraft while inflicting
      minimal collateral damage to the surrounding environment. It should
      generate a composite air situational picture for the operator and generate
      alerts based on user-defined parameters,” the requirements in the RFI
      said. Among the other specifications, it mentions that the radar should
      have 360-degree coverage with a range of 5 km for a mini unmanned aircraft
      system. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has
      developed an anti-drone technology to detect, intercept and shoot down
      drones. The transfer of technology has happened with BEL, while some other
      companies are also being considered. The DRDO had deployed the system last
      year during events like Republic Day, but many feel that for 24x7
      monitoring in hostile territory, the system needs to be further tested.
      The system is developed to jam drones up to 3 km and can bring down
      targets using a laser weapon at targets that are one to two kilometres
      away. There are options from the private industry as well that need to be
      closely studied. Hyderabad-based Grene Robotics said that it has developed
      India’s own drone dome ‘Indrajaal’ that can guard against drone threats.
      The SMASH 2000 system is fitted on a rifle and can be used to bring down
      drones. The Israeli system recognises, tracks and engages targets in the
      air with precision. While the Indian Navy has already opted for the
      Israeli anti-drone Smash rifles, the Jammu attack is a reality check for
      other forces to bring in similar capabilities to guard against drone
      attacks. The Indian Army and Border Security Forces are also looking at
      getting the weapon to enhance their on-ground anti-drone capabilities. The
      Israeli and US forces are among those who are using the system that can
      track and hunt down multiple targets. Developed by the Israeli company
      Sharpshooter, the SMASH system allows any soldier on the ground to be
      equipped with anti-drone capabilities as the system can be easily mounted
      on rifles.

      Brendan Taylor retires:- Brendan Taylor, the Zimbabwe wicketkeeper-batsman, has announced that he will be retiring after Monday's (September 13) ODI against Ireland in Belfast. Taylor, who had made his debut in 2004, went on to play 34 Tests, 204 ODIs and 45 T20Is - following which he became one of Zimbabwe's finest cricketers. Ahead of his last international assignment as a player, against Ireland, Taylor has a chance to end up as Zimbabwe's leading run-getter in the 50-over format (Currently 109 runs behind Andy Flower). With 11 centuries to his credit, the 34-year-old is already the country's leading century-maker in the format.He is the fourth highest run-getter for Zimbabwe in Tests, with 2320 runs in 34 matches, and third in T20Is behind Hamilton Masakadza and Sean Williams. "It's with a heavy heart that I'm announcing that tomorrow is my last game for my beloved country," Taylor stated on a Twitter post on Sunday. "17 years of extreme highs and extreme lows and I wouldn't change it for the world."It's taught me to humble, to always remind myself how lucky I was to be in the position I was in for so long. To wear the badge with pride and leave everything on the field. My goal was to always leave the team in a better position as to when I first arrived back in 2004, I hope I have done that."

      Tim Paine undergoes surgery:- Tim Paine, the Australian Test captain, is set to undergo surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his neck. In a release, on Monday (September 13), Cricket Australia stated, "Paine had been suffering pain in his neck and left arm due to a bulging disc which reduced his ability to train at full intensity and has not responded to treatment." Having consulted a spinal surgeon last week, he was recommended a surgery to relieve the pressure on the nerve, which would allow him to return to training later in the month. As a result, Paine is likely to miss out of Tasmania's first two Sheffield Shield matches, which are scheduled to be played in September. "The consensus of the spinal surgeon and the CA medical team was to have the surgery now which will allow plenty of time to fully prepare for the summer," Paine said."I expect to be able to restart physical activity by the end of this month and be back in full training in October. I will be ready to go by the first Test and am very much looking forward to what will be a huge summer."
