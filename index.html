        Taiwan warns of 'catastrophic consequences' if China invades Taiwan:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has sent nearly 150 planes into
        Taiwan’s air defence identification (ADIZ) zone in the first four days
        of October, in what mainland figures and media have labeled a
        demonstration of strength but which world governments condemned as an
        act of intimidation and aggression. Writing for Foreign Affairs
        magazine, Tsai stressed Taiwan’s desire for peace but said “if its
        democracy and way of life are threatened, Taiwan will do whatever it
        takes to defend itself”. However she also urged other nations to
        “understand the value of working with Taiwan”, against the broader
        threat posed by Beijing. “And they should remember that if Taiwan were
        to fall, the consequences would be catastrophic for regional peace and
        the democratic alliance system.” Advertisement Beijing claims Taiwan as
        a province in China, and has pledged to take it, by force if necessary.
        It considers Tsai’s government to be separatists, but she has said
        Taiwan is already a sovereign nation with no need to declare
        independence, and has no wish for conflict. “Amid almost daily
        intrusions by the People’s Liberation Army, our position on cross-strait
        relations remains constant: Taiwan will not bend to pressure, but nor
        will it turn adventurist, even when it accumulates support from the
        international community,” she said. Few countries formally recognise
        Taiwan, a situation which Tsai said had compelled Taiwan to think
        asymmetrically, forming unofficial partnerships and agreements, and
        contributing to international bodies as a non-state party. With growing
        ties around the world, Taiwan was an increasingly important democracy,
        trading partner and global supplier, and a crucial segment of the first
        island chain, which stretches from northern Japan to Borneo, Tsai said.
        “Should this line be broken by force, the consequences would disrupt
        international trade and destabilise the entire western Pacific,” she
        said. “In other words, a failure to defend Taiwan would not only be
        catastrophic for the Taiwanese; it would overturn a security
        architecture that has allowed for peace and extraordinary economic
        development in the region for seven decades.” On Tuesday, Japan’s
        foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said he hoped Taiwan and China were
        able to resolve the issues peacefully. He said Japan was weighing up
        possible scenarios in order to make its own preparations. It followed
        comments from Australia’s government and the US state department urging
        Beijing to cease its threats or use of force. The White House also said
        it was in private communications through diplomatic channels, about
        China’s actions regarding Taiwan. Taiwan hopes to provide a deterrence
        to China through strong international ties and investment in its defence
        capabilities, including arms purchases through the US. “Such initiatives
        are meant to maximise Taiwan’s self-reliance and preparedness and to
        signal that we are willing to bear our share of the burden and don’t
        take our security partners’ support for granted,” Tsai said. Taiwan was
        “fully committed to collaborating with our neighbours to prevent armed
        conflict in the East China and South China Seas, as well as in the
        Taiwan Strait”. Taipei warns that China will be able to invade Taiwan by
        2025 President Tsai Ing-wen appeals to democracies to help the island
        defend its independence.Taiwan’s defence minister has warned that China
        will be fully capable of invading the island by 2025, in the
        government’s first clear message to the public that the country faces a
        threat of war. “The current situation is really the most dangerous I
        have seen in my more than 40 years in the military,” Chiu said in a
        question-and-answer session with lawmakers about a NT$240bn ($8.6bn)
        special defence budget for anti-ship missiles and warships. “If they
        want to attack now, they are already capable. But they have to calculate
        at what cost it would come and what results it would have,” Chiu said.
        “From 2025, they will already have lowered the cost and the losses to
        the lowest possible level, so we call it they will have the complete
        capability.”Over the past year, Beijing has dramatically increased air
        and naval operations close to Taiwan. According to Taiwan’s defence
        ministry, 672 Chinese warplanes have flown into Taiwan’s air defence
        identification zone this year, far outpacing the 380 recorded in 2020.
        Some US officials and many experts have played down the significance of
        the People’s Liberation Army flights, saying that they were not the
        prelude to war but aimed instead at intimidating Taiwan and wearing down
        its air force, which scrambles fighters in response.

      <h2>Royal Bengal tiger drags away fisherman in Gosaba:-</h2>
      <p>
        In the third attack in four days, a royal Bengal tiger dragged away a
        fisherman inside the dense forest early on Tuesday, leading the
        Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (STR) authorities to issue a ban on fishing in
        creeks and rivers of Jhila forest. Asit Sarkar, 50, a fisherman from
        Gosaba, was taken away by a big cat when he went to catch crabs in
        creeks and rivers of Jhila. His co-workers said they tried to save him
        from the tiger but they were unsuccessful. The fisherman is still
        missing. “It is the third attack by tigers in four consecutive days and
        all incidents happened in the Jhila zone of the STR. So, we have issued
        a ban on fishing in an area covering 58sqkm of Jhila forest. We will
        keep an eye on the tigers to understand the reason for their aggressive
        behaviour,” said Jones Justin, the deputy field director of STR. The
        foresters said as per their survey there were two tigers who we suspect
        of attacking fishermen. The 2020-21 census shared by the Bengal
        administration on Wednesday, on the eve of the International Tiger Day,
        counted at least 96 tigers in the Indian territory of the Sunderbans. On
        Monday, the victim, Samad Mollah, 31, died in the tiger attack when he
        was catching crabs in Chilamari Khal, a creek in the delta. On Saturday,
        A 37-year-old fisherman Gour Mistri was severely injured by a Royal
        Bengal tiger in Gosaba of the Sunderbans and his co-workers were able to
        rescue him from the jaw of the big cat after fighting with bamboo sticks
        and oars. Sources in forest departments said apart from fishermen with
        official permission from the STR, many people illegally entered the
        restricted areas and risked their lives.

      <h2>Nine sheep killed in leopard attack in Anantapur,Andhra Pradesh:-</h2>
      <p>
        A leopard has created havoc in Anantapur district where it has attacked
        a herd of sheep leaving nine sheep killed in the attack. Going into the
        details, Chintakunta Anil Kumar, a farmer from M. Hanumapuram village in
        D. Hirehall mandal has a herd of sheep, which was attacked by a leopard.
        The Veterinary doctor Dr. Ramesh confirmed that 9 sheep were killed in
        the leopard attack. He said that up to Rs 90,000 was lost by the farmer
        due to the death of sheep. The affected farmer is deeply concerned over
        his loss and asked the concerned forest department officials to support
        him. The farmers said they were in a panic as a leopard roamed near the
        village and said that it has become a trouble to go to the fields.
        Earlier, leopard attacks have been on the rise in the Anantapur district
        recently. It is known that a leopard was spotted near Pala Venkatapuram
        in the Brahmasamudram mandal in the recent past.

      <h2>7 cages installed to trap leopard near Nashik, Maharashtra:-</h2>
      <p>
        The forest department, on the backdrop of two back-to-back incidents of
        leopards killing children in Nashik and Dindor talukas, has installed a
        total of seven cages to trap the big cat. Meanwhile, teams of forest
        department are also appealing to the people to not move out of their
        houses during the night along with keeping the children indoors after
        sunset. Two girls were killed within a span of three days in Wadgaon
        (Nashik) and Dhagur (Dindori). The villages are around 10km from each
        other, but they fall in two separate division of the forest department.
        Owing to this the east division of the forest department has installed
        four cages in Dhagur village, where a four year old girl was killed on
        Sunday night, and the west division has put up three cages in Wadgaon
        village where a five-year-old girl was killed on September 30. Apart
        from this, the forest department has also installed trap cameras in the
        villages concerned. Deputy conservator of forest (east), Nashik, Tushar
        Chavan said, “Apart from patrolling teams, the rescue cages and trap
        cameras, our personnel are spreading awareness among the villagers. The
        forest personnel are meeting the sarpanch of the villages, police patils
        and villagers to make them aware about how to protect themselves from a
        wild cat.” Officials of the east division said they were also taking
        help of the police department for patrolling.

        Firefighters Still Struggle To Douse Kolkata Building Fire After 30
        Hours:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        A massive blaze that engulfed a four-storey building in Kolkata's
        congested Colootola area around 30 hours ago is yet to be completely
        doused, with firefighters still toiling hard to put out pockets of
        flames, a senior official said today. No casualties have been reported,
        but a few firemen are known to have sustained injuries during the course
        of the operation, he said. A portion of the rear side of the building,
        which housed several small business establishments and storerooms,
        collapsed early on Tuesday morning, the fire department official said.
        At least 10 fire tenders are struggling to put out the small pockets of
        fire. "Last night, our officers, along with the help of locals and
        disaster management personnel, managed to bring the blaze largely under
        control. There are still some pockets of fire, and our personnel are
        making all efforts to douse them. It may take some more time," he
        stated. Thirty fire tenders were pressed into service on Monday to
        contain the fire. A couple of blasts had also occurred in the building,
        likely because of the cooking gas cylinders stored inside.

        ith the national rollout of Zydus Cadila’s Covid vaccine, ZyCoV-D just 2
        weeks away, different batches of ZyCoV-D are undergoing a final round of
        quality checks at the vaccine testing laboratory in Himachal Pradesh.
        Talking to TOI, NK Arora, chairman of the Centre’s Covid working group
        of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI)
        expressed that if everything works out as per their plan the vaccine
        will be introduced in the immunisation programme as early as October
        15-16. Around 1.5 lakh doses of Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D vaccine have
        cleared the quality test at Central Drugs Laboratory, in Kasauli,
        Himachal Pradesh, sources told CNN-News18, adding that the government is
        currently in negotiation with the manufacturers to bring down the
        commercial price of the jab. The manufacturers have quoted a price of Rs
        1,800 to 1,900 per dose, which the government feels is on the higher
        side for a three-dose vaccine, and wants a lower figure, the sources
        said. As ZyCov-D is the first DNA-based and needle-free vaccine, its
        price range, compared to other jabs, is set to be higher. The special
        applicator that the vaccine requires costs Rs 35,000, driving up the
        price range of the vaccine dose. The three-dose needle-free ZyCoV-D
        vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila is based on the
        plasmid DNA technology and follows a three-dose regimen with a 28-day
        gap between each dose. “Since it is a three-dose vaccine, we need to
        ensure availability of one crore doses each month for the next three
        months,” Arora added. The vaccine will be the first in India to be
        administered to children in the age groups of 12-18 years. According to
        the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the Covid working
        group is in favour of starting inoculations for children and the details
        of comorbidities and prioritisation of beneficiaries in adolescents will
        be released soon, government sources had said.

        <q>IPL:-</q> <q>MI vs RR:-</q> It was a must-win game for Rajasthan
        Royals, who were relatively better-placed than Mumbai Indians in their
        bid to make the play-offs. As was the case with MI who needed a win to
        stay alive in the IPL 2021. Both teams have had their fair share of
        struggles through the season, especially with their middle orders; MI
        more so in the UAE leg where they only managed a single win in 5 games.
        But when the stakes were high, they showed why they were the most
        successful team in the IPL, restricting RR first to just 90 - the lowest
        total in Sharjah this season by a team batting first - and then chased
        down the required runs with 70 balls to spare. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Evin
        Lewis gave RR a good start, again, as they have for majority of the
        second leg. The pair added 27 runs, found the boundaries six times and
        Lewis even cleared the fence once. Once they fell within the powerplay,
        RR couldn't find another boundary for the next 79 balls. The duo of
        Jimmy Neesham and Nathan Coulter-Nile wreaked havoc in the middle order
        as Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube and Glenn Phillips had returns of 3, 3 and
        4. It was another instance of the middle order's conspicuous failing in
        the absence of Samson coming to their rescue. A change in the middle
        order against CSK would've had their spirits up, but it came crumbling
        down when the weight of responsibility fell on it. Coulter-Nile mixed it
        up with his cutters and slower balls into the wicket, returning 4-14,
        once again delivering when called upon. While Neesham, playing his first
        game of this leg and second of the season, hit the right lengths and
        with his variations made the going tough for the batsmen who were
        increasingly wanting to play cross-batted shots, and playing across the
        line when the lengths were missing. Of the nine RR dismissals, five were
        either leg-before or bowled with MI's bowlers realizing early enough
        that the pitch wasn't one for stroke-playing. They responded aptly with
        straight bowling in the line of the stumps. They pulled back their
        lengths, brought in the offcutters, bowled seam up and ended up
        deceiving the batsmen. Ending the powerplay on 41/2, RR lost 49/7
        thereafter. A target of 91 was too little to expect much of a defence
        from RR's bowlers. In his brief stay of 13 balls for his 22, Rohit
        Sharma showed the merit of playing straight and in the 'V', giving MI
        the perfect start. They capitalized on that and made it count with Ishan
        Kishan coming good with a 50 off 25, stating after the game that they'd
        taken cues from RR's innings and conceding their plans of playing
        straight. But early wickets of their best batsmen had them play catch-up
        from very early in the innings, after which, a familiar picture
        presented itself. In 20 overs, RR's batsmen managed only 7 fours and 2
        sixes. MI's hit those in 5.3 overs, getting in five sixes and nine fours
        in all.
