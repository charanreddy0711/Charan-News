      <h2>Plane crashes, bursts into flames at Georgia airport; 4 dead:-</h2>
      <p>
        At least four people died after a single-engine plane crashed at the
        DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in the US state of Georgia on Friday, local
        media reported. According to the FOX 5 broadcaster, the Cessna 210
        single-engine flight crashed at PDK airport late night around 1:11 pm
        (local time) and caught fire. “It happened pretty fast,” photographer
        Keith Berry, told FOX 5 and added, "The plane just came and landed and
        it bounced a bit and when it bounced, that's when it tipped on its
        side." Airport authorities shut down all operations for a brief period
        after the crash. Identities of those who died have not been revealed
        yet. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation
        Safety Board have launched an investigation into the incident.

        ‘Taiwan question’ will be resolved, no external interference needed:
        China:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        Speaking in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate the
        110th anniversary of the revolution that ended the country's last
        imperial dynasty, Xi said the biggest obstacle to the reunification of
        China was the "Taiwan independence" force. Chinese President Xi Jinping
        on Saturday made a strong pitch for the reunification of Taiwan with the
        mainland amidst heightened tensions with the estranged island, saying
        the “Taiwan question” will be resolved and it brooks “no external
        interference”. Xi's comments came after China sent a record number of
        military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for four days in a row, in
        a public show of force. Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state - but
        China views the self-ruled island as a breakaway province. Beijing has
        not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification. The 1911
        Revolution led by nationalists headed by Dr Sun Yat-sen ended 2,132
        years of imperial rule and 276 years of Manchu rule and heralded the
        beginning of China's republican era followed by the formation of the
        People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Taiwan separated from the PRC
        in 1949 while fighting a civil war with the CPC headed by Mao Zedong.

        U.S. to accept international visitors who used WHO-approved COVID-19
        vaccines:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        The United States will accept the use by international visitors of
        COVID-19 vaccines authorized by U.S. regulators or the World Health
        Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late
        on Friday. On Sept. 20, the White House announced the United States in
        November would lift travel restrictions on air travelers from 33
        countries including China, India, Brazil and most of Europe who are
        fully vaccinated against COVID-19. It did not specify then which
        vaccines would be accepted. A CDC spokeswoman told Reuters Friday, “Six
        vaccines that are FDA authorized/approved or listed for emergency use by
        WHO will meet the criteria for travel to the U.S.” The new COVID-19
        vaccine requirements will now apply to nearly all foreign nationals
        flying to the United States — including those not subject to the prior
        restrictions. The CDC must still finalize and publish new contract
        tracing rules for international visitors, which it sent to the White
        House for review on Sept. 15. The CDC must also detail rules for
        exceptions, which include children not yet eligible for shots, as well
        as for visitors from countries where vaccines are not widely available.
        The administration must also decide whether to admit visitors part of
        COVID-19 clinical trials or have recently contracted COVID-19 and are
        not yet eligible for vaccination. (Reporting by David Shepardson;

      <h2>Tata Group Acquires Air India:-</h2>
      <p>
        Sixty-eight years after Air India's establishment as Tata Airlines and
        subsequent takeover by the government in 1953, life has moved full
        circle for Tata Sons as it becomes the new owner of the national carrier
        for $2.7 billion. SpiceJet founder Ajay Singh submitted the other bid
        for the flag carrier. Air India becomes Tata’s third airline
        acquisition. It also holds a majority stake in full-service Vistara with
        Singapore Airlines and AirAsia India with Malaysian AirAsia. Once the
        sale closes by the end of the year, Tata will get full ownership of Air
        India, its profitable subsidiary Air India Express, and 50 percent of
        its share of the joint venture with Singapore Airport Terminal Services
        (SATS), which provides ground handling services across airports in
        India. It will also inherit a brand that will need to be refurbished,
        2,000 engineers, 1,600 pilots, and a host of partnerships including Star
        Alliance. Rajiv Bansal, secretary of the Ministry of Civil Aviation,
        explained that the Tata Group would retain current employees of Air
        India for the first year. “In the second year, they will see who to
        retain and can also give voluntary retirement from service,” he said.
        Air India’s fleet consists of a mix of 117 wide- and narrow-body
        aircraft and AI Express flies 24 Boeing 737-800s. In 2020, Air India
        flew 63 million passengers, giving it a 26 percent market share on 172
        domestic routes. It operates 70 international routes, more than any
        other Indian carrier. More than two-thirds of its consolidated revenues
        come from the international market.

        <q>IPL:-</q> <q>RCB vs DC:-</q> Both Delhi Capitals and Chennai Super
        Kings will head into the first Qualifier with a loss in their last
        league match. Srikar Bharat and Glenn Maxwell helped Royal Challengers
        Bangalore bag a six-wicket win as the pair made 111 off 63 to chase down
        a target of 165 on the final ball of the game. Needing five off the last
        ball, Bharat smashed a six against Avesh Khan to seal the win. Both
        Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw have been the rocks the DC batting has
        revolved around. However, in UAE, there have been signs of struggle with
        the highest stand being 24 in four innings prior to this game. Put in,
        Dhawan and Shaw collaborated to score 88 in the opening ten overs to lay
        a solid platform for the middle order. They scored 20 in the first two
        overs but slowed down a touch in the next two overs. DC ended the
        powerplay with 55 on the board. If DC scored 88 in the opening ten, they
        were able to manage just 76 in the final ten. Harshal Patel remove
        Dhawan first before Yuzvendra Chahal got rid of Shaw for 48. Eight balls
        later, Daniel Christian had Rishabh Pant caught behind to leave DC
        struggling a touch at 108 for 3. Shreyas Iyer and Shimron Hetmyer made
        35 off 30 while the latter collaborated with Ripal Patel to make 21 off
        14. The late flourish DC needed never really arrived and although
        Hetmyer fell only on the last ball of the innings, he was able to manage
        just 29 off 22. In the last match, Devdutt Padikkal made 41 off 52 as
        RCB lost a close contest to Sunrisers Hyderabad and also lost an
        opportunity to finish in the top two. On the night, Anrich Nortje handed
        the left-hander a golden duck to leave the opener with some worry lines
        ahead of the Eliminator against Kolkata Knight Riders. Nortje then
        struck again to remove the RCB captain as Kohli was caught at mid-on
        with RCB reeling on 6 for 2. RCB had just 29 on the board when the
        powerplay ended and were left even more vulnerable when AB de Villiers
        was dismissed for a run-a-ball 26 in the tenth over with 55 on the
        board. Bharat's maiden IPL fifty couldn't have come at a better time for
        RCB. They had 66 for 3 in 11 overs but Bharat and Glenn Maxwell upped
        the ante to nullify the advantage DC had gained. At the end of the 16th
        over, RCB had picked up 53 more runs to leave a more manageable 46 off
        24 to give DC a scare. Kagiso Rabada's 17th over needed to be a quiet
        one but Maxwell struck a boundary and Bharat got a six to take 15 off
        the over. With 31 needed off 18, and the pair in complete control, DC
        needed something special to put the breaks on. Nortje gave just four in
        the penultimate over to leave RCB needing 15 off 6. DC were sloppy on
        the field throughout the innings and that came back to bite them in the
        end. Avesh Khan started the final over well with 4, 2, 1lb, dot on the
        first four deliveries. Then things unravelled for DC. On the fifth
        delivery, Bharat mistimed a stroke to long-on but the fielder took it
        all too easy and allowed Bharat a second. A wide followed as RCB were
        left needing five off the last ball. Bharat smashed the last ball over
        long-on to leave DC bruised ahead of the all-important Qualifier. Avesh,
        when Bharat missed connecting the fourth delivery, stood mid-pitch
        laughing on the face of the batter. As things turned out, it was Bharat
        who had the last laugh.

        <q>IPL:-</q><q>MI vs SRH:-</q> In their last game of the season - and
        before the big auctions for the next season - Mumbai Indians bowed out
        with an entertaining fight, despite beating SRH by 42 runs. They arrived
        into the contest needing a miraculous performance, and got half of it
        via Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav's incredible shot-making to end
        with the highest total of IPL 2021. But their NRR battle with
        fellow-fourth spot aspirant KKR proved to be a bridge too far for them.
        An unthinkable 171-run victory, which meant they had to bat first and
        throw themselves at every delivery to get a total well beyond 200 to
        even stand a chance. Rohit Sharma said the numbers in front of them were
        scary, but crossed the first hurdle by winning the toss and batting
        first. Ishan Kishan started the carnage with four fours off Sidharth
        Kaul in the second over, and didn't spare any of Manish Pandey's other
        PowerPlay bowling options. A 22-run over from Jason Holder and 15 off
        the young and impressive Umran Malik took MI to 83/1 in 6 overs - the
        highest PowerPlay score of the season. It was made possible by a
        bludgeoning hand that Kishan played - getting to a 16-ball half-century
        and carrying forward his murderous intent on the night. Umran Malik had
        two good outings, turning heads with his pace in the late 140s and even
        early 150s, supported well by impressive lines. But on a flat Abu Dhabi
        strip, he bore the brunt of Kishan's exuberant ways, who even saw
        through the tyro's change of pace and carted him for a six. As Pandey
        changed his bowlers around, there was no immediate solution in sight.
        Even Rashid Khan was not spared the blushes, as Hardik Pandya walked out
        at no.3 and tonked him for a six in his first over. Hardik fell in the
        ninth over to Holder, and Malik saw the back of Kishan in the 10th - to
        end the MI opener's scintillating knock of 84 from just 32 deliveries
        that included 11 fours and 4 sixes. MI added just 27 runs between the
        9th and the 13th over and were five down, going a little off-track from
        their endeavour to score well in excess of 200.Hardik fell in the ninth
        over to Holder, and Malik saw the back of Kishan in the 10th - to end
        the MI opener's scintillating knock of 84 from just 32 deliveries that
        included 11 fours and 4 sixes. MI added just 27 runs between the 9th and
        the 13th over and were five down, going a little off-track from their
        endeavour to score well in excess of 200. The MI batsman hasn't been
        himself this season but shrugged that off with ease. He picked up pace
        after a double-wicket over from Abhishek Sharma in the 13th, and got
        going soon against Kaul in the following over. It was amply evident that
        he'd well and truly rekindled his old, menacing touch when he stretched
        across and slog swept Rashid for a big six in the 16th over. He followed
        up Kishan's top-half act with a 24-ball half century of his own. MI's
        death-overs batting made up for their mini-stutter through the middle as
        they added 58 runs off the last 30 deliveries. Suryakumar finished with
        82 off 40 - with 13 fours and 3 sixes - powering the side to an
        entertaining 235/9, which meant they needed to bowl out SRH for 65 or
        lower. Even with that batting performance, MI were clutching at straws
        considering they had to bundle out SRH for such a small score on a
        batting belter. Those hopes were quickly wiped out when Jason Roy
        managed to go after two Jasprit Bumran overs in the PowerPlay. MI's
        season was officially over at 5.5 when SRH scored the 66th run of the
        chase. Though Roy fell just before getting his team past 65, Abhishek
        Sharma - in his second game as an opener - was intent on keeping SRH on
        track in chase. He matched Roy shot for shot in the first six overs, and
        showed gumption to do it after as well, but mistimed an innocuous James
        Neesham delivery, hitting it straight to Nathan Coulter-Nile in the
        deep. Though Manish Pandey started well in his game back, SRH stuttered
        as Mohammad Nabi and Abdul Samad fell, taking the team to 105 for 4 in
        10 overs. Not entirely. Pandey and Priyam Garg attempted it, smashing 56
        off 36 balls to keep the team alive. Even with SRH needing 80 off 30
        balls, the game seemed in the balance considering how the entire evening
        had shaped up for stroke-making. The real Bumrah showed up. He took out
        Garg with a slower ball first up in the 16th over to nip the chase in
        the bud. With the asking rate climbing to nearly 18, the only way out
        for SRH was to take risks. Jason Holder, Rashid Khan and Wriddhiman Saha
        fell trying to do that and SRH's chase quickly went downhill from there.
        Pandey got an unbeaten 69 but MI walked away with a 42-run victory.
