      <h2>Corona Virus News:-</h2>
      <h3>
        Today 20,799 corona cases and 180 deaths have been registered in India.
        Today 765 covid cases, 9 people died from covid in last 24 hours in
        Andhra Pradesh. Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday said
        that 70 per cent of India's adult population has been administered the
        first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. With the administration of 23,46,176
        vaccine doses in the last 24 hours, the cumulative COVID-19 vaccine
        doses administered has exceeded 90.79 crore as per provisional reports
        till 7 am. According to officials, 25 per cent of the population has
        been administered both the doses. Festivals, holiday season can bring in
        third COVID wave early by 2 weeks, says study. The active cases comprise
        0.78 percent of the total infections, the lowest since March 2020, while
        the national COVID-19 recovery rate was recorded at 97.89 percent, the
        highest since March 2020, the ministry said.
      </h3>
      <p>
        A study showed that the third-wave peak could increase by up to 47 per
        cent during the holiday season. The ICMR said that individuals should be
        advised not to travel if they have COVID-like symptoms, including a
        prolonged dry cough, or loss of taste and smell. It said that states may
        consider requiring proof of completed vaccination status, or a recent
        COVID-negative test result, in order to stay at accommodations in
        destinations within the state.

        Order issued to shoot and kill elusive man-eating tiger in Tamil Nadu:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        After an elusive man-eating tiger in Tamil Nadu killed its fourth victim
        in the span of a few days, the Chief Conservator of Forests Sekhar Kumar
        Niraj issued orders to shoot it dead immediately. After the tiger, which
        had killed a shepherd in an estate near Gudalur, about 80 km from here,
        on Friday last, the forest department started search operations to trap
        the feline by tranquilising it. However, the tiger, with injuries, gave
        the slip to nearly 100 forest department staff and officials, including
        some from the Special Task Force from Kerala and two tamed elephants for
        the last eight days. The carnivore was found roaming in Mayfield, two km
        from the spot on September 29 and it killed a goat. The tiger entered
        Attakarai, coming under Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, some 40 km from the
        estate and killed an 85-year old man this afternoon, creating panic
        among villagers, who demanded action to trap it. The tiger has so far
        killed four people, 20 cows and a goat. Two kumki elephants, 3 dog
        squads join hunt for tiger in Masinagudi today. Bhosale Sachin
        Thukkaram, Deputy Director of the MTR (core area), said the tiger was
        not spotted on Sunday, and the search area had been expanded to
        Masinagudi and Singara. He said camera traps placed around the search
        area would be combed for images of the tiger to understand its movement.
        The operation would continue on Monday.

      <h2>Can we bring back the woolly mammoth?:-</h2>
      <img
        src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/10/Woolly_mammoth.jpg"
        alt="Woolly Mammoth"
      />
      <p>
        Male woolly mammoths were thought to reach shoulder heights of up to
        3.5m – roughly the size of an African elephant – and to weigh up to six
        tonnes. The imperial mammoth weighed over 10 tonnes and the Songhua
        River Mammoth of northern China weighed up to 15 tonnes. Perhaps the
        most pronounced physical difference between mammoths and elephants is
        their tusks. Mammoth tusks were typically longer in proportion to body
        size and more dramatically twisted and curved than elephant tusks. ...
        In comparison, the African elephant has fewer and diamond-shaped tooth
        ridges.The team of scientists led by George Church, a geneticist at
        Harvard Medical School, will use genetic engineering to develop a
        cold-resistant elephant or an ‘Arctic elephant’. Several news reports
        have pointed out that the company has received $15 million in initial
        funding. Last month, a company named Colossal, announced that it has
        started a landmark de-extinction project to resurrect the woolly
        mammoth, which went extinct roughly 10,000 years ago. The team has
        selected over 50 traits that will enhance the cold-resistant ability of
        an Asian elephant. These include shaggy coats, smaller ears,
        cold-adapted forms of haemoglobin and excess adipose tissue production.
        The idea is to use these genes and with the help of CRISPR technology
        insert them into the Asian elephant’s genome. The team will then create
        an embryo that carries the traits of a woolly mammoth. The embryo will
        be implanted into a surrogate African elephant. The gestation in the
        elephant’s womb will take place for around 18-22 months and a hybrid
        ‘Arctic elephant’ will be born. Colossal mentions on its website that
        one of the core goals for reviving the mammoth is to revert the
        now-overshrubbed forests into natural arctic grasslands, which will help
        with carbon emissions. “We would need an area of somewhere between one
        and three million square kilometre at first to have an impact. But
        considering there are about 20 million square kilometre of Arctic,
        that’s a small fraction,” Dr. George Church said. Ben Lamm, the founder
        and CEO of Colossal Biosciences, told reporters that one can see the
        first generation of ‘Arctic elephant’ calves in four to six years. “Our
        goal is a little over a decade before we get full reintroduction,” he
        added. Lamm said that the short-term plan includes developing veterinary
        reproductive technologies for endangered species in particular, and for
        endangered environments and ecosystems.

          draw:-</q
        >
        The two sides settled for a draw as the time ran out on the final day in
        Carrara. Both teams earned two points each meaning Australia lead the
        multi-format series with 6 points heading into the three T20Is while
        India are on 4. Chasing 272 runs in the final session of the final day,
        Australia negotiated a draw despite losing two early wickets. India held
        command in the majority of the Test but that wasn't enough to force a
        result as rain on the first two days significantly reduced the number of
        overs bowled. Smriti Mandhana with her maiden Test century was awarded
        the Player of the Match. On the final day, Ellyse Perry and Ashleigh
        Gardner initiated the proceedings of what unfolded to be an exciting
        Test finish. The pair assimilated 89 runs for the fifth wicket
        partnership with both going past fifty. Gardner was first to fall with
        Deepti Sharma striking after Mithali Raj completed a low catch at
        mid-off. With the new ball now in hand, Meghna Singh struck with Annabel
        Sutherland's wicket who went back for 3. On the final day, Ellyse Perry

        20.3 overs. Punam Raut's quick-fire 41 off 61 deliveries took India's
        total to 135/3 and the lead past 271 runs before they declared.
        Australia's reply in the fourth innings saw a couple of hiccups early
        with Jhulan Goswami sending Alyssa Healy packing for 6 while Pooja
        Vastrakar snared Beth Mooney's wicket for 11. Meg Lanning (17*) and
        Ellyse Perry (1*) stayed on the crease when the two sides mutually
        decided to call it a draw with time running out and a win for either
        side out of the equation.

        <q>IPL:-</q> <q>RCB vs PBKS:-</q> The Royal Challengers Bangalore
        cruised into the playoffs with a six-run win over Punjab Kings on Sunday
        (October 3). They became the third team to qualify after Chennai Super
        Kings and Delhi Capitals. Well, as they have for most of the season. The
        openers did their job once again with a solid stand that fetched them 68
        runs. They were fortunate to survive a number of chances, mind you, but
        made the most of them, albeit both Virat Kohli and Devdutt Padikkal
        playing sedate knocks. Ravi Bishnoi's first over had two missed chances,
        two clean hits and two instances of the batsman being beaten. However,
        that wasn't as dramatic as his second. PBKS were already frustrated with
        the slew of missed chances, transcending into their fielding too, when
        Bishnoi bowled another googly to Padikkal. The opener was already having
        trouble reading them and attempted to reverse-heave. Rahul appealed for
        a caught-behind, but the on-field decision was not out. Rahul was
        certain there was an edge and took the review. Snicko showed a clear
        spike when the ball went past the glove on the way to the 'keeper, but
        the TV umpire adjudged it not out, much to the annoyance of Rahul who
        was seen in prolonged conversations with the umpire thereafter. Punjab
        Kings got back into the game... With Moises Henriques's triple strike.
        With the middle-order struggling, PBKS gave the Australian all-rounder a
        go and he delivered in his first over, scalping both Kohli and Daniel
        Christian in successive balls. He bowled the perfect cutter to Kohli
        that stayed low and knocked out the offstump, ending the 68-run opening
        stand. Christian was promoted up the order and hit out straight to
        backward point off a full first ball. In his next over, Henriques got
        Padikkal to nick one off the toe-end of his bat. Henriques finished with
        career-best IPL figures of 3-12. Thanks to Glenn Maxwell's third
        successive half-century. He came in at a time when PBKS had crawled
        their way back into the game, strengthening their grip on proceedings on
        the back of Moises Henriques's strikes. He responded in the only way he
        knows - with a counterattack. The 165 that RCB had set Punjab was the
        highest total in Sharjah this season. PBKS got a good start with a
        91-run opening stand, but Yuzvendra Chahal's three-wicket spell in the
        middle was the game-changer as Punjab lost their way, once again, and
        dug a hole for themselves. KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal added the highest
        opening partnership against RCB this season with a superb 91. Mayank
        took on the role of the aggressor getting to another half-century, while
        Rahul was happy to support him. They rotated the strike effectively and
        Mayank spared neither the pacers nor spinners. Rahul fell for 39 in the
        11th over, but the platform was set for PBKS to finish well. However,
        from overs 12-17, PBKS lost four for 38 runs as RCB made a spectacular
        comeback.

        <q>KKR vs SRH:-</q> Kolkata Knight Riders gained two crucial points from
        their victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday (October 3) to give
        themselves some breathing space in the heavy traffic route for the last
        playoffs spot. Wriddhiman Saha thought about a review, consulted Jason
        Roy, and decided not to. Sadly for him, replays revealed that the
        Southee delivery in the opening over was going over the stumps. Roy
        edged one and timed one well for a couple of boundaries off Southee
        before he failed to clear mid on off Shivam Mavi's bowling. If not for
        Kane Williamson's four fours in an over off Mavi, the Sunrisers wouldn't
        even have reached 35/2 that they did. The spinners then kept it tight as
        SRH could manage only 51/3 in the first 10 overs. Shakib Al Hasan's
        inclusion in the Knight Riders' eleven paid dividends soon after he came
        on to bowl. Shakib was quick to run and collect the ball at short mid
        wicket and hit the stumps direct at the non-striker's end to send
        Williamson back for 26 off 21. A few quiet overs later, Abhishek Sharma
        stepped down the track rather early to Shakib, which proved to be a big
        mistake. Shakib had figures of 1-10 from three overs, and despite being
        hit for a six off Priyam Garg - which was the first boundary for SRH
        after 37 deliveries - the Bangladesh allrounder gave away only 20 runs
        in his quota of four overs which were bowled at one go. Sunil Narine
        bowled four overs and did not pick up a wicket but did not concede a
        single boundary either. Varun CV finished with 2-26 despite being struck
        three sixes off Abdul Samad, who then got out to Southee. Rashid Khan's
        helicopter shot over cover for a four and off Mavi and Siddarth Kaul's
        boundary off Southee in the same region off the final ball, were the
        only boundaries in the last three overs, which yielded just 16 runs.
        There was as many as 56 dots bowled by the Knight Riders in the innings,
        highlighting the Sunrisers' inability to rotate the strike. The Knight
        Riders' spinners conceded only 58 runs in the 12 overs bowled by them,
        which played a key role in restricting the Sunrisers to 115/8. While the
        batsman around him struggled, Shubman Gill guided his team in the chase
        with a 51-ball 57 that resulted in the Knight Riders' six-wicket victory
        which helped them consolidate the fourth spot. Rahul Tripathi also
        struck a four off Bhuvneshwar Kumar, but his three overs for only 13
        runs and Holder's two overs for 13 runs meant that the Knight Riders
        could only get 36/1 in the powerplay. Tripathi struck a Rashid delivery
        straight to short mid wicket to depart for 7. While the Knight Riders
        had used spin to keep the Sunrisers in check after the first six overs,
        Williamson preferred the pace of Jammu & Kashmir's Umran Malik (who had
        earlier clocked 150 kph - the fastest delivery in this IPL) to bowl in
        tandem with Siddarth Kaul. They both did a good job of containment,
        resulting in the Knight Riders managing only 44/2 at the end of 10
        overs. It was a role from start to nearly the finish for Gill, who
        ensured that the Knight Riders' innings did not stagnate at any stage
        despite the Sunrisers bowlers helping their team stage a fine fightback
        after posting a meagre total. When Venkatesh Iyer struggled in the
        powerplay, it was Gill found the boundaries to ensure the Knight Riders
        did not leave too much for later. He bided his time when the pacers
        bowled tight lines, but quickly got into the act with Nitish Rana
        struggling with his scoring rate at the other end. Gill was on 25 off 29
        at the end of the 10th over but he quickly changed gears and reached his
        first fifty in IPL 2021, off 44 deliveries. During this phase, he struck
        six fours that helped bring the asking rate in the Knight Riders'
        control. Kaul finally dismissed Gill while Holder sent Rana back. With
        10 required off the last two overs, Dinesh Karthik helped the team over
        the line - albeit with only two balls to spare.
