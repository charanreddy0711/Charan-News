      <h2>Chinese military activity near Taiwan provocative: U.S:-</h2>
      <p>
        The United States on Monday, October 4, 2021 termed the Chinese military
        activity near Taiwan as provocative. “We remain concerned by the
        People's Republic of China's provocative military activity near Taiwan,
        which is destabilising risk miscalculations and undermines regional
        peace and stability,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. “We
        urge Beijing to seize its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure
        and coercion against Taiwan, and we have an abiding interest in peace
        and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” she said. “That's why we will
        continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence
        capability. We maintain our commitments, as outlined in the three
        communiques, Taiwan Relations Act, and the Six Assurances,” she said.
        “We have been clear, privately and publicly, about our concern about the
        PRC's pressure and coercion toward Taiwan, and we will continue to watch
        the situation very closely,” she said. In a separate statement, Senator
        Marco Rubio said 145 Chinese warplanes have flown into or near Taiwan’s
        air defense identification zone since October 1, 2021. These military
        incursions occurred just days before Taiwan’s National Day and began on
        the People’s Republic of China’s National Day. “The Chinese Communist
        Party’s aggressive behavior is intended to intimidate Taiwan and send a
        message to the rest of the free world,” Rubio said. “If Beijing’s
        recklessness is not met with international condemnation, Xi Jinping will
        think he has a green light for further aggression. President Joe Biden
        must work with our allies to ensure the People’s Republic of China
        respects the status quo and the sovereign territory of Taiwan and its
        neighbours,” he said.

      <h2>Male leopard rescued from 35-ft-deep well in Pune:-</h2>
      <p>
        A male leopard about four years old was rescued from a 35-foot-deep well
        by the Maharashtra Forest Department and non-profit organisation
        Wildlife SOS at Narayanwadi in Pune district’s Junnar following an
        operation that lasted over two hours. The animal was kept under
        observation for a few days and later released back into the wild. Dr
        Nikhil Bangar, Veterinary Officer of Wildlife SOS, said the animal was
        placed under close observation “while he recuperated from this stressful
        ordeal. Fortunately, he had not sustained any severe injuries and was
        safely released back into the wild.” The leopard was first spotted late
        Thursday night by local residents who heard rumbling noises in the well.
        Upon inspection, they were shocked to find a leopard struggling to climb
        out of the deep well. The residents immediately contacted the forest
        department. Wildlife SOS, which operates out of the Manikdoh Leopard
        Rescue Centre, was also called in for reinforcements. In order to ensure
        that the big cat did not drown, a team of village rescuers trained by
        Wildlife SOS and the forest department lowered a metallic plank into the
        well. Relieved to find a dry surface, the distressed leopard climbed
        onto it. Upon arrival, the four-member rescue team from Wildlife SOS,
        along with forest officials, meticulously lowered a trap cage into the
        well to extricate the animal. The leopard leapt into the cage which was
        subsequently pulled up and transported to the Manikdoh Centre for
        medical observation. “The expansive sugarcane fields make Narayanwadi a
        leopard-prone area. Leopards often come here to hunt and unintentionally
        fall into these open wells,” said Ajit Shinde, Range Forest Officer.
        Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO of Wildlife SOS, pointed out that the open
        wells in Maharashtra have been a constant threat to leopards.
        “Unsuspecting animals fall into these wells and gravely injure
        themselves or even die due to drowning, starvation or injuries. These
        rescue operations need to be carried out swiftly and with caution by
        trained professionals. We are grateful to the village rescue team that
        acted promptly and alerted the concerned authorities.”

      <h2>Two minor boys drown in Arabian sea, says BMC:-</h2>
      <p>
        Two minor boys drowned in the Arabian Sea off south Mumbai, the
        Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Disaster Control said on Tuesday.The
        tragedy occurred when a group of eight youngsters went for a swim
        opposite the Priyadarshini Park in Malabar Hill. However, two of them
        failed to return ashore.

        A-61-year-old person died after a four-storey building collapsed in
        south Mumbai’s Kalbadevi area on Sunday:-
      </h2>
      <p>
        The deceased has been identified as Sundara Saw. He was taken to J J
        Hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. According to local
        residents, Saw was talking on the phone when the dilapidated
        Khanderaowadi Building Number 5, which is owned by Maharashtra Housing
        and Area Development Authority (MHADA), came down crashing on him. Local
        BJP corporator Aakash Raj Purohit said that a major tragedy was averted
        as the building was evacuated after a portion of the toilet collapsed on
        Sunday evening. “After a part of the toilet fell, the fire brigade and
        police were called in. There were around 20 labourers inside the
        building and all of them were evacuated by the fire brigade. Also, one
        family from a nearby building was shifted as a safety measure,” He
        further said, “However, around 10.30pm a person was sitting next to the
        building while talking on the phone. The entire building collapsed and
        he was stuck inside the debris. He was rescued and shifted to J J
        Hospital where doctors declared him dead.” The Khanderaowadi Building
        Number 5 was more than four decades old. “The building was only used for
        commercial purposes. It was mostly frequented by Bengali labourers who
        worked in local jewellery-making units,” the corporator said.

      <h2>Corona Virus News:-</h2>
      <h3>
        Today 18,346 corona cases and 263 deaths have been registered in India.
        Today 429 covid cases, 4 people died from covid in last 24 hours in
        Andhra Pradesh. The effectiveness of the Pfizer Inc /BioNTech SE vaccine
        in preventing infection by the coronavirus dropped to 47% from 88% six
        months after the second dose, according to data published on October 4
        that U.S. health agencies considered when deciding on the need for
        booster shots. The analysis showed that the vaccine's effectiveness in
        preventing hospitalization and death remained high at 90% for at least
        six months, even against the highly contagious Delta variant of the
        coronavirus.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Corona virus getting more airbourne. Newer variants of the coronavirus
        such as alpha and delta are highly contagious, infecting far more people
        than the original virus. Two new studies offer a possible explanation:
        The virus is evolving to spread more efficiently through air. The
        realization that the coronavirus is airborne indoors transformed efforts
        to contain the pandemic last year, igniting fiery debates about masks,
        social distancing and ventilation in public spaces. “This is not an
        Armageddon scenario,” said Vincent Munster, a virus expert at the
        National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who led one of
        the new studies. “It is like a modification of the virus to
        more-efficient transmission, which is something I think we all kind of
        expected, and we now see it happening in real time.” The second study
        found that people infected with alpha exhaled about 43 times more virus
        into tiny aerosols than those infected with older variants. The studies
        compared the alpha variant with the original virus or other older
        variants. But the results may also explain why the delta variant is so
        contagious — and why it displaced all other versions of the virus. “It
        really indicates that the virus is evolving to become more efficient at
        transmitting through the air,” said Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne
        viruses at Virginia Tech who was not involved in either study. “I
        wouldn’t be surprised if, with delta, that factor were even higher.”

        <q>IPL:-</q> <q>DC vs CSK:-</q> Delhi Capitals made a meal of what
        should've been an easier chase, but got over the line in the end to take
        another step towards a top-two finish. After a rare Ruturaj Gaikwad
        failure, CSK just didn't have the batting impetus to impose themselves,
        crashing and burning their way to 136/5. The young opener has been CSK's
        most influential performer since IPL arrived in UAE, but Anrich Nortje
        stopped him in his tracks, bouncing him out with sheer pace. Gaikwad,
        who survived an LBW decision through a review in the very first over,
        couldn't duck under this short ball in the fifth over, mistiming his
        pull to Ashwin at mid-on. By this stage, CSK had lost both their openers
        as Faf du Plessis smashed a hit-me short ball from Axar Patel straight
        to Shreyas Iyer at deep midwicket. The Gaikwad effect worked in the
        opposite direction tonight, as his dismissal led a wobbly CSK into the
        middle phase where they were thoroughly strangled. Based on how the
        India leg went, Moeen Ali was meant to be as big a threat against spin,
        but that hasn't quite translated since the season moved to UAE. The
        left-hander looked to take on the form bowler - Axar - and paid the
        price as he hit a leg stump delivery straight to Iyer at deep midwicket.
        Robin Uthappa had the opportunity to make his mark after getting off the
        bench for the first time this season. He was circumspect to start off on
        a two-paced surface, and perished with his first attempt to break the
        lethargy. The right-hander failed to spot Ashwin's carrom ball, and his
        attempt to swipe it to the leg side resulted in a big leading edge that
        Ashwin pouched. Their fifth-wicket stand stretched all the way to the
        final over, but it was a phase where CSK were pinned to the mat. CSK
        went boundary-less for a period 35 balls, until Avesh Khan's leg-side
        loosener gave Rayudu some respite in the 12th over. But that was only
        one of five fours that CSK managed in the second half of the innings -
        all coming off Rayudu. He also hit the only two sixes of the innings,
        while Dhoni struggled on his way to a 27-ball 18 - his worst-ever IPL
        innings when he has played 25 balls or more. Between them, Axar and
        Ashwin conceded 38 runs and picked three wickets in eight overs. CSK's
        two senior statesmen, meanwhile, put on a stodgy 70-run stand off 64
        balls, while their better death-overs hitters Bravo and Jadeja were sat
        in the dugout waiting for their turn. A few hits from Rayudu in the 18th
        and 19th over took him to a half-century, and dragged CSK to 136/5,
        which felt under-par at that stage. The Delhi Capitals top-order
        struggled to keep Shikhar Dhawan company, consistently giving CSK a way
        back from an unfavourable position. Deepak Chahar once again proved to
        be Prithvi Shaw's nemesis - seeing the back of him for the seventh time
        in IPL. Shaw got a touch too adventurous trying to get on top of his
        duel against a familiar adversary, and ended up miscuing a heave to Du
        Plessis at mid-off. Though Dhawan was intent on dragging the game away
        swiftly, Iyer's early dismissal meant DC had a very similar PowerPlay to
        CSK. With wickets falling, DC lost a bit of rhythm to their chase, while
        Dhawan fought a lone battle at the other end. Debutant Ripal Patel
        showed the most promise among the other top-order batters, but he too
        was gone after a 20-ball appearance for 18 runs. A double-wicket Thakur
        over threatened to entirely derail DC's chase when he got rid of Dhawan
        and Ravichandran Ashwin, leaving DC on 99 for 6, and in need of 38 from
        30. It stubbornly remained on an even keel, as Hetmyer and Axar
        navigated past two stingy five-run overs from Moeen Ali and Shardul
        Thakur, before the eventful West Indian-v-West Indian face-off
        materialised. Between the drop from Gowtham in a 12-run over and a big
        six that was clobbered off Hazlewood in the 19th, Hetmyer had done
        enough to achieve what he later admitted he was really paid to do at DC
        - finish games. In Bravo's previous over, Hetmyer used his familiarity
        with his West Indian compatriot from playing against him in CPL and
        second-guessed the lengths outside the off-stump, to negate Bravo's wide
        yorkers. Bravo still should've won the tussle there, but Krishnappa
        Gowtham fluffed a straight catching chance at long on to push it to the
        final over. On the first ball of the final over too, Bravo went full and
        wide, and once again Hetmyer shuffled across and hit through cover to
        pick up a couple of runs. MS Dhoni then called for his helmet to stand
        up to the stumps and stop Hetmyer from leaving his crease, but Bravo
        couldn't control his slower one and bowled it wide outside the pitch.
        After much deliberation, the ball was adjudged a wide - instead of a
        no-ball. Ricky Ponting seemed miffed but the umpires got it absolutely
        right. As per law 21.7, it would've been given a no-ball - accompanied
        by a free-hit - had the ball bounced before going past the stumps at the
        striker's end. But since the ball carried on the full all the way behind
        the stumps, the umpires rightly called it a wide. As Axar and Hetmyer
        stole a single, the former was left to get 2 off 5. Axar swung and
        missed on the next, and then hit straight to Moeen Ali at cover to drag
        CSK back into the fixture. Bravo added to the tension by running in and
        pulling out of the ball at the last minute, but Rabada was steady to put
        away a leg side ball to the fine leg fence and complete the chase.
