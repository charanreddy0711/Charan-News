    <h2>Corona Virus News:-</h2>
    <h3>
      Today 27,176 corona cases and 284 deaths have been registered in India.
      Today 1,125 covid cases, 9 people died from covid in last 24 hours in
      Andhra Pradesh. India achieved another milestone on Monday in its fight
      against Coronavirus infection; the country has crossed the 75-crore mark
      in vaccination, the fastest among the world to achieve the feat. However,
      at this rate, India will be able to cover 43% of its population by the end
      of the year. India needs to vaccinate at least 60% of its population to
      avoid the impending Covid-19 third wave, as per experts. According to the
      estimate, India requires 12 million doses per day to achieve the target.
      Now, India has the most partly immunized people in the world. The country
      has administered 60% of its eligible adult population with the first dose
      of the Covid-19 vaccine while 19% have received both doses, according to
      data from the Union Health Ministry. Experts said "Outbreaks will close
      schools and cancel classes. Vaccinated nursing home residents will face
      renewed fears of infection. Workers will weigh the danger of returning to
      the office as hospitals are overwhelmed, once again. Almost everyone will
      be either infected or vaccinated before the pandemic ends, experts agree.
      Maybe both. An unlucky few will contract the virus more than once. The
      race between the waves of transmission that lead to new variants and the
      battle to get the globe inoculated won't be over until the coronavirus has
      touched all of us." Night curfew in Andhra Pradesh extended from September
      16 to 30.

    <h2>Covid Compared to Other Pandemics:-</h2>
    <h3>
      The five well-documented influenza pandemics of the past 130 years offer
      some blueprint for how Covid might play out, according to Lone Simonsen,
      an epidemiologist and professor of population health sciences at Roskilde
      University in Denmark. She is an expert on the ebb and flow of such
      events. While the longest global flu outbreak lasted five years, they
      mostly consisted of two to four waves of infection over an average of two
      or three years, she said. Covid is already shaping up to be among the more
      severe pandemics, as its second year concludes with the world in the
      middle of a third wave and no end in sight. It's possible that the virus
      known as SARS-CoV-2 won't follow the path set by the pandemics of the
      past. After all, it is a different, novel and potentially more
      transmissible pathogen. And with a death count of more than 4.6 million
      people so far, it's already more than twice as deadly as any outbreak
      since the 1918 Spanish flu. Nations where vaccination has been sparse
      including Malaysia, Mexico, Iran and Australia- are in the midst of their
      biggest outbreaks yet, fueled by the contagious delta strain. With the
      virus still spreading out of control in vast swathes of the planet,
      another novel variant could quite feasibly emerge. History shows the
      commonly held belief that viruses automatically get milder over timeto
      avoid completely wiping out their host population is wrong, according to
      Simonsen. Although new mutations aren't always more severe than their
      predecessors, "pandemics can in fact get more deadly during the pandemic
      period, as the virus is adapting to its new host," she said. Early in the
      Covid outbreak, there was good reason to hope that vaccines would provide
      long-term protection, much like childhood shots that stop diseases such as
      polio. Coronaviruses have a "proof-reading" mechanism that fixes the
      in-born errors caused when the virus replicates, reducing the likelihood
      of variants emerging when the virus is transmitted from one person to
      another. Covid could be like the flu, requiring regular vaccine top-ups to
      remain effective as the virus evolves. Some researchers say SARS-CoV-2 is
      poised to become completely resistant to the first generation of vaccines.
      A study from Japan, which has yet to be published or peer-reviewed,
      suggests that potentially dangerous mutations in the delta variant are
      already being picked up in a global database used to track such
      developments. "This is a scenario we hope won't happen," Simonsen said.
      "My God, we would have to do it all again." "As long as there are animal
      reservoirs of coronavirus there is still the possibility that another
      zoonotic coronavirus could emerge in the future," Subbarao said.

    <h2>Building collapses in Delhi:-</h2>
    <h3>
      A four-storey building collapsed in North Delhi's Sabzi Mandi area on
      Monday. Two siblings died and an elderly man sustained injuries after a
      four-storey building collapsed in North Delhi’s Sabzi Mandi Monday. Police
      said renovation at a shop on the ground floor might have led to the
      collapse. North MCD officials at the spot said the construction was
      illegal. “A case has been registered against the shop owner, Mohak Arora,
      under IPC sections 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to
      murder), 288 and 34,” said a senior officer. “The brothers were passing by
      with their mother when the building collapsed. They were trapped under the
      debris.” The victims were identified as Somya Gupta (12) and his younger
      brother Prashant Gupta (8). Police said their father, Nitin Gupta (38),
      works at a shop in Sadar Bazar while their mother is a homemaker. The
      incident took place around 11.45 am and locals called the Delhi Fire
      Services and police. Initially, five fire tenders were sent and a
      75-year-old man, Ramji Das, was pulled out. He was sitting inside his pan
      shop on the ground floor when the building came down. DFS Chief Atul Garg
      said over 50 personnel were deployed: “Rescue work started at 11.50 am and
      went on till 9-10 pm. Narrow lanes made it difficult for fire tenders and
      cranes to reach the spot.” The building used to be owned by a businessman,
      Laxman Prasad, who later sold it to his relatives. It housed two small
      shops on the ground floor while three siblings lived with their families
      on the floors above. Residents claimed renovation work began seven-eight
      days ago and the drilling and digging led to cracks on the wall but no
      complaint was filed. Hemantika Aneja, who runs a nursery school and lived
      with her family on the first floor, said: “I was at office when I heard
      about the collapse. The owner of one of the shops was undertaking
      renovations… we told him to take permission from authorities, but he said
      he’ll manage. We have lost the house we had been living in for 35 years.”
      Thirteen people lived in the building. Aneja said all of them, except her
      nephew Aryan (18), were not at home at the time. Aryan was on the second
      floor and managed to escape. Kiran Kumar, who lives nearby, said, “Many
      people here are making more floors or a basemen. but these structures are
      weak and can collapse anytime.”

      Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that there
      will be a complete ban on storage, sale, and bursting of all kinds of
      firecrackers this year too. The decision has been taken in wake of the
      situation of pollution in Delhi during Diwali in the last three years.
      District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday issued a fresh
      order allowing public fairs and exhibitions in the national capital from
      September 16. The order further stated that schools in the city will
      continue to remain closed for students up to Class 8. Schools for students
      from class 9th allowed with 50% capacity of classroom.

      GST Council may consider bringing petrol, diesel under GST on September
      17:-
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Tax experts said bringing petro products under GST will be a tough call
      for both the Centre and states as both will stand to lose. The GST Council
      might on Friday consider taxing petrol, diesel and other petroleum
      products under the single national GST regime, a move that may require
      huge compromises by both central and state governments on the revenues
      they collect from taxing these products. The Council, which comprises
      central and state finance ministers, in its meeting scheduled in Lucknow
      on Friday, is also likely to consider extending the time for duty relief
      on COVID-19 essentials, according to sources in the know of the
      development. GST is being thought to be a solution for the problem of
      near-record high petrol and diesel rates in the country, as it would end
      the cascading effect of tax on tax (state VAT being levied not just on the
      cost of production but also on the excise duty charged by the Centre on
      such output). In June, the Kerala High Court, based on a writ petition,
      had asked the GST Council to decide on bringing petrol and diesel within
      the goods and services tax (GST) ambit. When a national GST subsumed
      central taxes such as excise duty and state levies like VAT on July 1,
      2017, five petroleum goods petrol, diesel, ATF, natural gas and crude oil
      were kept out of its purview for the time being. This is because both
      central and state government finances relied heavily on taxes on these
      products. The Centre will also lose as the majority of the Rs 32.80 per
      litre excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 on diesel is made up of cesses,
      which it does not share with the states. Under GST, all revenues will be
      split 50:50 between the Centre and the states. This is the first time in
      20 months that the GST Council will have a physical meeting. The last such
      meeting was on December 18, 2019, before the COVID-19-induced lockdowns.
      This meant that the central government continued to levy excise duty on
      them while state governments charged value-added tax (VAT). These taxes,
      with excise duty, in particular, have been raised periodically. While the
      taxes have not come down, a spike in global oil prices on demand recovery
      has pushed petrol and diesel to an all-time high, leading to demand for
      them to come under the GST. Including oil products in GST will not just
      help companies set off tax that they paid on input but will also bring
      about uniformity in taxation on the fuels in the country. The Council, in
      its 45th meeting on Friday, would also consider extending the duty relief
      available on COVID-19 essentials. The previous Council meeting was held
      via videoconferencing on June 12 during which tax rates on various
      COVID-19 essentials were reduced till September 30.

    <h2>China Locks Down City of 4.5 Million as Delta Surges Again. :-</h2>
    <h3>
      China locked down a city of 4.5 million people in the southeastern
      province of Fujian after detecting a dozen coronavirus cases, an attempt
      to once again halt a delta outbreak and maintain its strict zero-tolerance
      approach to Covid-19. The latest outbreak, which has yet to escape the
      Fujian province, includes 103 cases in three cities thus far. The first
      cases were detected in two students from local schools through routine
      testing. Their father, who returned from overseas in early August, was
      also infected and is considered as the likely origin. The wave comes less
      than a month after China fought off the broadest outbreak in the country
      since the virus first emerged in Wuhan. The fast and furious measures
      taken by local authorities reflect the difficulty of containing the more
      transmissible delta variant and the escalation China needs to undertake to
      sustain its Covid Zero status. Starting Tuesday, all kindergartens,
      primary and middle schools in Xiamen will be closed, and students have
      been asked to attend classes online. The city’s long-distance bus station
      suspended all routes to other provinces in order to cut the risk of
      transmission. Some parts of Xiamen have initiated mass testing, and local
      authorities plan to roll out citywide testing, according to deputy mayor
      Liao Huasheng.

    <h2>Putin in self-isolation due to COVID cases in inner circle:-</h2>
    <h3>
      Russian President Vladimir Putin entered self-isolation after people in
      his inner circle became infected with the coronavirus, the Kremlin said
      Tuesday, adding that the leader himself tested negative for COVID-19.
      Putin, who is fully vaccinated with Russia’s Sputnik V, held several
      public engagements indoors Monday and even said that he may have to
      quarantine soon. An aide at the time sought to suggest he was speaking
      generally and insisted Tuesday that no one’s heath was endangered. During
      a daily conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
      said that Putin, 68, is “absolutely healthy” but had come in contact with
      someone who contracted the virus. Asked if Putin tested negative for the
      virus, Peskov said “definitely, yes.” Peskov didn’t say when Putin began
      self-isolating, when he tested negative, how long he would remain in
      self-isolation or who among the president’s contacts was infected. During
      a videoconference with government officials and members of the ruling
      United Russia party, Putin said that several people in his “immediate
      circle” were infected with the virus, including a staff member who he was
      in close contact with throughout Monday. That staffer was vaccinated and
      recently got “revaccinated,” Putin said, apparently referring to a third
      shot that Russia is offering people who were immunized more than six
      months ago. “Three days after revaccination he fell ill,” Putin said. “We
      will see how Sputnik V really works.” Putin has hardly ever worn a mask
      publicly, though he appeared to work largely remotely and was rarely seen
      in public for a period before he was vaccinated.

    <h2>Bombs Thrown Again At Bengal BJP MP's Home:-</h2>

      Arjun Singh has alleged that the ruling Trinamool Congress has sheltered
      goons responsible for the attack. Bombs exploded outside Bengal BJP MP
      Arjun Singh's house around 9 this morning -- a day after the Union Home
      Ministry ordered the National Investigation Agency probe into the attack
      of September 8, when three bombs were hurled at the gate of his home at
      Bhatpara, about 40 km from Kolkata. The state police have called in the
      bomb squad and CCTV footages of the bombing are being examined. Trinamool
      MLA Partha Bhowmik has denied the allegation, saying the MP stage-managed
      the blasts to stay politically relevant. Mr Singh also alleged that the
      attack indicated that the Bengal government was challenging the NIA. "A
      second bomb attack was carried out outside my property today. The West
      Bengal government is challenging the NIA. An attempt is being made to
      create an atmosphere of fear. The NIA should investigate where such
      explosives are being sourced from. I have filed an FIR," he was quoted as
      saying by news agency ANI. On September 8, around 6.30 in the morning,
      three men on a bike threw bombs at the MP's house at Bhatpara in his
      Barackpore constituency, about 40 km from Kolkata. The leader was in Delhi
      at the time, but his family members were inside the house. No one was
